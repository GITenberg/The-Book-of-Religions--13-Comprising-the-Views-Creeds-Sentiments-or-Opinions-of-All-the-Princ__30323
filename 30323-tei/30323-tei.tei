<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
A few years since, the Editor of the following pages published
a volume of <q>Religious Creeds and Statistics;</q> and, as the work,
although quite limited, met with general approbation, he has been
induced to publish another of the same nature, but on a much larger
plan, trusting that it will prove more useful, and more worthy of
public favor.
</p>

<p>
His design has been, to exhibit to his readers, with the utmost
impartiality and perspicuity, and as briefly as their nature will
permit, the views, creeds, sentiments, or opinions, of all the
religious sects or denominations in the world, so far as utility
seemed to require such an exhibition; but more especially to give
the rise, progress, and peculiarities, of all the principal schemes
or systems of religion which exist in the United States at the
present day.
</p>

<p>
The work is intended to serve as a manual for those who are
desirous of acquiring, with as little trouble as possible, a correct
knowledge of the tenets or systems of religious faith, presented
for the consideration of mankind;&mdash;to enable them, almost at a
glance, to compare one creed or system with another, and each
with the holy Scriptures;&mdash;to settle the minds of those who have
formed no definite opinions on religious subjects;&mdash;and to lead
us all, by contrasting the sacred truths and sublime beauties of
Christianity with the absurd notions of pagan idolaters, of skeptics,
and of infidels, to set a just value on the doctrines of HIM <hi rend='smallcaps'>who
spake as never man spake</hi>.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this design, the Editor has obtained, from the most
intelligent and candid among the living defenders of each denomination,
full and explicit statements of their religious sentiments&mdash;such
as they believe and teach. He is indebted to the friends of
some new sects or parties in philosophy and religion, for an account
of their respective views and opinions. With regard to
<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>
anterior sects, he has noticed, from the best authorities, as large a
number as is thought necessary for the comparison of ancient with
modern creeds.
</p>

<p>
The Church and Missionary Statistics are believed to be as
accurate as can be constructed from materials which annually undergo
greater or less changes.
</p>

<p>
The Biographical Sketches are derived from the most authentic
sources. While they convey useful knowledge in regard to
the fathers and defenders of the various systems of religious
faith, they may also stimulate our readers to the practice of
those Christian virtues and graces which adorned the lives of
many of them, and render their names immortal.
</p>

<p>
A few only of the works from which valuable aid has been
received, can be mentioned:&mdash;Mosheim and McLaine's Ecclesiastical
History; Gregory and Ruter's Church History; Encyclopædia
Americana; Brown's Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge;
Adams's View of Religions, and History of the Jews; Benedict's
History of all Religions; Evans's Sketches; Buck's and Henderson's
Theological Dictionaries; Eliot's, Allen's, and Blake's
Biographical Dictionaries; Davenport; Watson; Grant's Nestorians,
Coleman's Christian Antiquities; Ratio Disciplinæ; Haydn's Dictionary
of Dates, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
To clergymen and laymen of all denominations, who have assisted
the Editor in presenting their various views with clearness and
fairness; to the secretaries of the several missionary boards; to
editors of religious journals, and to other persons who have kindly
furnished documents for the Statistics and Biographical Sketches,
he tenders acknowledgments of unfeigned gratitude.
</p>

<p>
While the Editor assures the public that the whole has been
prepared with much diligence and care, and with an entire freedom
from sectarian zeal or party bias, he cannot but indulge the hope
that his <q>Book of Religions</q> will prove acceptable and beneficial
to the community, as imbodying a great variety of facts on a subject
of deep concern, worthy of the exercise of our highest faculties,
and requiring our most charitable conclusions.

<head>Lutherans, Or, The Evangelical Lutheran Church.</head>

<p>
This denomination adheres to the opinions of Martin
Luther, the celebrated reformer.
</p>

<p>
The Lutherans, of all Protestants, are those who differ
least from the Romish church, as they affirm that the body
and blood of Christ are materially present in the sacrament
of the Lord's supper, though in an incomprehensible manner:
this they term <hi rend='italic'>consubstantiation</hi>. They likewise represent
some rites and institutions, as the use of images in
churches, the vestments of the clergy, the private confession
of sins, the use of wafers in the administration of the Lord's
supper, the form of exorcism in the celebration of baptism,
and other ceremonies of the like nature, as tolerable, and
some of them useful. The Lutherans maintain, with regard
to the divine decrees, that they respect the salvation or
misery of men in consequence of a previous knowledge of
their sentiments and characters, and not as founded on the
mere will of God. See <hi rend='italic'><ref target='augsburg-confession'>Augsburg
Confession of Faith</ref></hi>.
</p>

<p>
Towards the close of the last century, the Lutherans began
to entertain a greater liberality of sentiment than they had
before adopted, though in many places they persevered longer
in despotic principles than other Protestant churches. Their
public teachers now enjoy an unbounded liberty of dissenting
from the decisions of those symbols of creeds which were
once deemed almost infallible rules of faith and practice, and
<pb n='010'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>
of declaring their dissent in the manner they judge most
expedient.
</p>

<p>
The capital articles which Luther maintained are as
follow:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. That the holy Scriptures are the only source whence
we are to draw our religious sentiments, whether they relate
to faith or practice. (See 2 Tim. 3:15-17. Prov. 1:9.
Isa. 8:20. Luke 1:4. John 5:39; 20:31. 1 Cor 4:6,
&amp;c.)
</p>

<p>
2. That justification is the effect of faith, exclusive of good
works, and that faith ought to produce good works, purely in
obedience to God, and not in order to our justification. (See
Gal. 2:21.)
</p>

<p>
3. That no man is able to make satisfaction for his sins.
(See Luke 17:10.)
</p>

<p>
In consequence of these leading articles, Luther rejected
tradition, purgatory, penance, auricular confession, masses,
invocation of saints, monastic vows, and other doctrines of
the church of Rome.
</p>

<p>
The external affairs of the Lutheran church are directed
by three judicatories, viz., a vestry of the congregation, a
district or special conference, and a general synod. The
synod is composed of ministers, and an equal number of
laymen, chosen as deputies by the vestries of their respective
congregations. From this synod there is no appeal.
</p>

<p>
The ministerium is composed of ministers only, and
regulates the internal or spiritual concerns of the church,
such as examining, licensing, and ordaining ministers, judging
in controversies about doctrine, &amp;c. The synod and ministerium
meet annually.
</p>

<p>
Confession and absolution, in a very simple form, are practised
by the American Lutherans; also confirmation, by
which baptismal vows are ratified, and the subjects become
communicants. Their liturgies are simple and impressive,
and the clergy are permitted to use extempore prayer. See

<head>Calvinists.</head>

<p>
This denomination of Christians, of the Congregational
order, are chiefly descendants of the English Puritans, who
founded most of the early settlements in New England.
They derive their name from John Calvin, an eminent reformer.
</p>

<p>
The Calvinists are divided into three parties,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>High</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Strict</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>Moderate</hi>.
The <hi rend='italic'>High</hi> Calvinists favor the Hopkinsian
system. The <hi rend='italic'>Moderate</hi> Calvinists embrace the leading
features of Calvin's doctrine, but object to some parts,
particularly to his views of the doctrines of predestination,
and the extent of the design of Christ's death. While they
hold to the election of grace, they do not believe that God
has reprobated any of his creatures. They believe that the
atonement is, in its nature, general, but in its application,
particular; and that free salvation is to be preached to sinners
indiscriminately. The doctrines of the <hi rend='italic'>Strict</hi> Calvinists
are those of Calvin himself, as established at the synod of
Dort, A. D. 1618, and are as follow, viz.:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. They maintain that God hath chosen a certain number
of the fallen race of Adam in Christ, before the foundation
of the world, unto eternal glory, according to his immutable
purpose, and of his free grace and love, without the
least foresight of faith, good works, or any conditions performed
by the creature; and that the rest of mankind he was
pleased to pass by, and ordain to dishonor and wrath, for
their sins, to the praise of his vindictive justice. (See Prov.
16:4. Rom. 9: from ver. 11 to end of chap.; 8:30. Eph. 1:4.
Acts 13:48.)
</p>

<p>
2. They maintain that, though the death of Christ be a
most perfect sacrifice, and satisfaction for sins, of infinite
value, abundantly sufficient to expiate the sins of the whole
world,&mdash;and though, on this ground, the gospel is to be
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
preached to all mankind indiscriminately, yet it was the will
of God that Christ, by the blood of the cross, should efficaciously
redeem all those, and those only, who were from
eternity elected to salvation, and given to him by the Father.
(See Ps. 33:11. John 6:37; 10:11; 17:9.)
</p>

<p>
3. They maintain that mankind are totally depraved, in
consequence of the fall of the first man, who being their
public head, his sin involved the corruption of all his posterity,
and which corruption extends over the whole soul, and
renders it unable to turn to God, or to do any thing truly
good, and exposes it to his righteous displeasure, both in this
world and that which is to come. (See Gen. 8:21. Ps. 14:2, 3.
Rom. 3:10, 11, 12, &amp;c.; 4:14; 5:19. Gal. 3:10.
2 Cor. 3:6, 7.)
</p>

<p>
4. They maintain that all whom God hath predestinated
unto life, he is pleased, in his appointed time, effectually to
call, by his word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death,
in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus
Christ. (See Eph. 1:19; 2:1, 5. Phil. 2:13. Rom. 3:27.
I Cor. 1:31, Titus 3:5.)
</p>

<p>
5. Lastly, they maintain that those whom God has
effectually called, and sanctified by his Spirit, shall never
finally fall from a state of grace. They admit that true
believers may fall partially, and would fall totally and
finally, but for the mercy and faithfulness of God, who
keepeth the feet of his saints; also, that he who bestoweth
the grace of perseverance, bestoweth it by means of reading
and hearing the word, meditation, exhortations, threatenings,
and promises; but that none of these things imply
the possibility of a believer's falling from a state of justification.

<head>Hopkinsians.</head>

<p>
This denomination of Christians derives its name from
Samuel Hopkins, D. D., formerly pastor of the first Congregational
church in Newport, R. I.
</p>

<p>
The following is a summary of the distinguishing tenets
of the Hopkinsians, together with a few of the reasons they
bring forward in support of their sentiments:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That all true virtue, or real holiness, consists in
disinterested benevolence. The object of benevolence is
universal being, including God and all intelligent creatures.
It wishes and seeks the good of every individual, so far as
is consistent with the greatest good of the whole, which
is comprised in the glory of God and the perfection and
happiness of his kingdom. The law of God is the standard
of all moral rectitude or holiness. This is reduced into love
to God, and our neighbor as ourselves; and universal good-will
comprehends all the love to God, our neighbor, and
ourselves, required in the divine law, and, therefore, must be
the whole of holy obedience. Let any serious person think
what are the particular branches of true piety; when he has
viewed each one by itself, he will find that disinterested
friendly affection is its distinguishing characteristic. For
instance, all the holiness in pious fear, which distinguishes it
from the fear of the wicked, consists in love. Again, holy
gratitude is nothing but good-will to God and our neighbor,&mdash;in
which we ourselves are included,&mdash;and correspondent
affection, excited by a view of the good-will and kindness
of God. Universal good-will also implies the whole of the
duty we owe to our neighbor; for justice, truth, and faithfulness,
are comprised in universal benevolence; so are temperance
and chastity. For an undue indulgence of our appetites
and passions is contrary to benevolence, as tending to hurt
ourselves or others, and so, opposite to the general good, and
the divine command, in which all the crime of such indulgence
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
consists. In short, all virtue is nothing but benevolence
acted out in its proper nature and perfection; or love to God
and our neighbor, made perfect in all its genuine exercises
and expressions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That all sin consists in selfishness. By this is meant
an interested, selfish affection, by which a person sets himself
up as supreme, and the only object of regard; and nothing
is good or lovely in his view, unless suited to promote his
own private interest. This self-love is, in its whole nature,
and every degree of it, enmity against God; it is not subject
to the law of God, and is the only affection that can oppose
it. It is the foundation of all spiritual blindness, and, therefore,
the source of all the open idolatry in the heathen world,
and false religion under the light of the gospel: all this is
agreeable to that self-love which opposes God's true character.
Under the influence of this principle, men depart from truth,
it being itself the greatest practical lie in nature, as it sets
up that which is comparatively nothing above universal existence.
Self-love is the source of all profaneness and impiety
in the world, and of all pride and ambition among men,
which is nothing but selfishness, acted out in this particular
way. This is the foundation of all covetousness and sensuality,
as it blinds people's eyes, contracts their hearts, and
sinks them down, so that they look upon earthly enjoyments
as the greatest good. This is the source of all falsehood,
injustice, and oppression, as it excites mankind by undue
methods to invade the property of others. Self-love produces
all the violent passions&mdash;envy, wrath, clamor, and evil
speaking; and every thing contrary to the divine law is
briefly comprehended in this fruitful source of all iniquity&mdash;self-love.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That there are no promises of regenerating grace
made to the doings of the unregenerate. For, as far as men
act from self-love, they act from a bad end; for those who
have no true love to God, really do no duty when they
attend on the externals of religion. And as the unregenerate
act from a selfish principle, they do nothing which is commanded;
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
their impenitent doings are wholly opposed to
repentance and conversion, therefore not implied in the
command to repent, &amp;c.: so far from this, they are altogether
disobedient to the command. Hence it appears that
there are no promises of salvation to the doings of the
unregenerate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That the impotency of sinners, with respect to
believing in Christ, is not natural, but moral; for it is a
plain dictate of common sense, that natural impossibility
excludes all blame. But an unwilling mind is universally
considered as a crime, and not as an excuse, and is the very
thing wherein our wickedness consists. That the impotence
of the sinner is owing to a disaffection of heart, is evident
from the promises of the gospel. When any object of good
is proposed and promised to us upon asking, it clearly evinces
that there can be no impotence in us, with respect to obtaining
it, besides the disapprobation of the will; and that
inability which consists in disinclination, never renders any
thing improperly the subject of precept or command.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That, in order to faith in Christ, a sinner must
approve, in his heart, of the divine conduct, even though God
should cast him off forever; which, however, never implies
love of misery, nor hatred of happiness. For if the law is
good, death is due to those who have broken it. The Judge
of all the earth cannot but do right. It would bring everlasting
reproach upon his government to spare us, considered
merely as in ourselves. When this is felt in our hearts, and
not till then, we shall be prepared to look to the free grace
of God, through the redemption which is in Christ, and to
exercise faith in his blood, <q>who is set forth to be a propitiation
to declare God's righteousness, that he might be just,
and yet be the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. That the infinitely wise and holy God has exerted his
omnipotent power in such a manner as he purposed should
be followed with the existence and entrance of moral evil
into the system. For it must be admitted on all hands, that
God has a perfect knowledge, foresight, and view of all
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
possible existences and events. If that system and scene of
operation, in which moral evil should never have existed,
were actually preferred in the divine mind, certainly the
Deity is infinitely disappointed in the issue of his own operations.
Nothing can be more dishonorable to God than to
imagine that the system which is actually formed by the
divine hand, and which was made for his pleasure and glory,
is yet not the fruit of wise contrivance and design.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. That the introduction of sin is, upon the whole, for
the general good. For the wisdom and power of the Deity
are displayed in carrying on designs of the greatest good;
and the existence of moral evil has, undoubtedly, occasioned
a more full, perfect, and glorious discovery of the infinite
perfections of the divine nature, than could otherwise have
been made to the view of creatures. If the extensive manifestations
of the pure and holy nature of God, and his infinite
aversion to sin, and all his inherent perfections, in their
genuine fruits and effects, is either itself the greatest good,
or necessarily contains it, it must necessarily follow that the
introduction of sin is for the greatest good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. That repentance is before faith in Christ. By this
is not intended, that repentance is before a speculative belief
of the being and perfections of God, and of the person and
character of Christ; but only that true repentance is previous
to a saving faith in Christ, in which the believer is united
to Christ, and entitled to the benefits of his mediation and
atonement. That repentance is before faith in this sense,
appears from several considerations. 1. As repentance and
faith respect different objects, so they are distinct exercises
of the heart; and therefore one not only may, but must, be
prior to the other. 2. There may be genuine repentance of
sin without faith in Christ, but there cannot be true faith in
Christ without repentance of sin; and since repentance is
necessary in order to faith in Christ, it must necessarily be
prior to faith in Christ. 3. John the Baptist, Christ, and
his apostles, taught that repentance is before faith. John
cried, <q>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;</q> intimating
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
that true repentance was necessary in order to embrace
the gospel of the kingdom. Christ commanded, <q>Repent ye,
and believe the gospel.</q> And Paul preached <q>repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. That, though men became sinners by Adam, according
to a divine constitution, yet they have, and are accountable
for, no sins but personal; for, 1. Adam's act, in eating
the forbidden fruit, was not the act of his posterity; therefore
they did not sin at the same time he did. 2. The
sinfulness of that act could not be <emph>transferred</emph> to them
afterwards, because the sinfulness of an act can no more be
transferred from one person to another than an act itself.
3. Therefore Adam's act, in eating the forbidden fruit, was
not the <emph>cause</emph> but only the <emph>occasion</emph>, of his posterity's being
sinners. God was pleased to make a constitution, that, if
Adam remained holy through his state of trial, his posterity
should, in consequence, be holy also; but if he sinned, his
posterity should, in consequence, be sinners likewise. Adam
sinned, and now God brings his posterity into the world
sinners. <emph>By</emph> Adam's sin we are become sinners, not <emph>for</emph> it;
his sin being only the <emph>occasion</emph>, not the <emph>cause</emph>, of our
committing sins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>10. That, though believers are justified <emph>through</emph> Christ's
righteousness, yet his righteousness is not <emph>transferred</emph> to
them. For, 1. Personal righteousness can no more be transferred
from one person to another, than personal sin. 2. If
Christ's personal righteousness were transferred to believers,
they would be as perfectly holy as Christ, and so stand in no
need of forgiveness. 3. But believers are not conscious of
having Christ's personal righteousness, but feel and bewail
much indwelling sin and corruption. 4. The Scripture represents
believers as receiving only the <emph>benefits</emph> of Christ's
righteousness in justification, or their being pardoned and
accepted for Christ's righteousness' sake; and this is the
proper Scripture notion of imputation. Jonathan's righteousness
was imputed to Mephibosheth when David showed
kindness to him for his father Jonathan's sake.</q>

The Hopkinsians warmly contend for the doctrine of the
divine decrees, that of particular election, total depravity,
the special influences of the Spirit of God in regeneration,
justification by faith alone, the final perseverance of the
saints, and the consistency between entire freedom and absolute
dependence, and, therefore, claim it as their just due,
since the world will make distinctions, to be called <hi rend='smallcaps'>Hopkinsian
Calvinists</hi>.

<head>Arians.</head>

<p>
The followers of Arius, a presbyter of the church of
Alexandria, about A. D. 315, who held that the Son of God
was totally and essentially distinct from the Father; that he
was the first and noblest of those beings whom God had
created, the instrument by whose subordinate operation he
formed the universe, and, therefore, inferior to the Father,
both in nature and dignity; also, that the Holy Ghost was
not God, but created by the power of the Son. The Arians
owned that the Son was the Word, but denied that Word to
have been eternal. They held that Christ had nothing of
man in him but the flesh, to which the Word was joined,
which was the same as the soul in us.
</p>

<p>
In modern times, the term <hi rend='italic'>Arian</hi> is indiscriminately applied
to those who consider Jesus simply subordinate to the
Father. Some of them believe Christ to have been the creator
of the world; but they all maintain that he existed
previously to his incarnation, though, in his preëxistent state,
they assign him different degrees of dignity.

<head>Socinians.</head>

<p>
A sect so called from Faustus Socinus, who died in
Poland, in 1604. There were two who bore the name of
Socinus,&mdash;uncle and nephew,&mdash;and both disseminated the
same doctrine; but it is the nephew who is generally considered
as the founder of this sect. They maintain that
Jesus Christ was a mere man, who had no existence before
he was conceived by the Virgin Mary; that the Holy Ghost
is no distinct person; but that the Father is truly and properly
God. They own that the name of God is given, in the
holy Scriptures, to Jesus Christ, but contend that it is only
a deputed title, which, however, invests him with a great
authority over all created beings. They deny the doctrines
of satisfaction and imputed righteousness, and say that Christ
only preached the truth to mankind, set before them, in himself,
an example of heroic virtue, and sealed his doctrines
with his blood. Original sin, and absolute predestination,
they esteem scholastic chimeras. Some of them likewise
maintain the sleep of the soul, which, they say, becomes insensible
at death, and is raised again, with the body, at the
resurrection, when the good shall be established in the possession
of eternal felicity, while the wicked shall be consigned
to a fire that will not torment them eternally, but for
a certain duration, proportioned to their demerits. (See Acts
2:22; 17:31. 1 Tim. 2:5.)

<head>Sectarians.</head>

<p>
This term is used among Christians to denote those who
form separate communions, and do not associate with one
another in religious worship and ceremonies. Thus we call
Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists, different sects, not so much on
account of their differences in opinion, as because they have
established to themselves different fraternities, to which, in
what regards public worship, they confine themselves; the
several denominations above mentioned having no intercommunity
with one another in sacred matters. High, Strict,
and Moderate Calvinists, High Church and Low Church, we
call only parties, because they have not formed separate communions.
Great and known differences in opinion, when
followed by no external breach in the society, are not considered
constituting distinct sects, though their differences in
opinion may give rise to mutual aversion.
</p>

<p>
The Jewish, Christian, Mahometan, and Pagan world is
divided into an almost innumerable variety of sects, each
claiming to themselves the title of orthodox, and each
charging their opponents with heresy.
</p>

<p>
Where perfect religious liberty prevails, as in the United
States, and where emigrants from all quarters of the globe
resort in great numbers, it is not surprising that most of the
Christian sects in foreign countries, with some of native
origin, should be found in this part of the American continent.

<head>Church Government.</head>

<p>
There are three modes of church government, viz., the
<hi rend='italic'>Episcopalian</hi>, from the Latin word
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>episcopus</foreign>, signifying
<hi rend='italic'>bishop</hi>; the <hi rend='italic'>Presbyterian</hi>,
from the Greek word <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>presbuteros</foreign>,
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
signifying <hi rend='italic'>senior</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>elder</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>presbyter</hi>; and the Congregational
or Independent mode. Under one of these
forms, or by a mixture of their several peculiarities, every
church in the Christian world is governed. The Episcopal
form is the most extensive, as it embraces the Catholic,
Greek, English, Methodist, and Moravian churches.
</p>

<p>
Episcopalians have three orders in the ministry, viz.,
bishops, priests, and deacons; they all have liturgies, longer
or shorter, which they either statedly or occasionally use.
All Episcopalians believe in the existence and the necessity
of an apostolic succession of bishops, by whom alone regular
and valid ordinations can be performed.
</p>

<p>
The Presbyterians believe that the authority of their ministers
to preach the gospel and to administer the sacraments
is derived from the Holy Ghost, by the imposition of the
hands of the presbytery. They affirm, however, that there
is no order in the church, as established by Christ and his
apostles, superior to that of presbyters; that all ministers,
being ambassadors of Christ, are equal by their commission;
that <hi rend='italic'>presbyter</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>bishop</hi>, though different words, are of the
same import; and that prelacy was gradually established upon
the primitive practice of making the <hi rend='italic'>moderator</hi>, or speaker
of the presbytery, a permanent officer.
</p>

<p>
The Congregationalists, or Independents, are so called
from their maintaining that each congregation of Christians,
which meets in one house for public worship, is a complete
church, has sufficient power to act and perform every thing
relating to religious government within itself, and is in no
respect subject or accountable to other churches.
</p>

<p>
Independents, or Congregationalists, generally ordain their
ministers by a council of ministers called for the purpose:
but still they hold that the essence of ordination lies in the
voluntary choice and call of the people, and that public ordination
is no other than a declaration of that call.

<head>Presbyterians.</head>

<p>
The first settlers of New England were driven away from
Old England, in pursuit of religious liberty. They were
required to conform to the established Protestant Episcopal
church, in all her articles of belief, and modes of worship
and discipline: their consciences forbade such conformity:
their ministers were displaced: their property was tithed for
the support of an ecclesiastical prelacy, which they renounced;
and the only relief which they could find, was
in abandoning their country for the new world.
</p>

<p>
Most of the first settlers of New England were Congregationalists;
and established the government of individuals by
the male communicating members of the churches to which
they belonged, and of congregations by sister congregations,
met by representation in ecclesiastical councils. A part of
the ministers and people of Connecticut, at a very early period
of her history, were Presbyterians in their principles of
church government. Being intermixed, however, with Congregational
brethren, instead of establishing presbyteries in
due form, they united with their fellow-Christians in adopting,
in 1708, the Saybrook Platform, according to which the
churches and pastors are consociated, so as virtually to be
under Presbyterian government, under another name.
</p>

<p>
The first Presbyterian churches duly organized in the
United States, were the first Presbyterian church in Philadelphia,
and the church at Snow Hill, in Maryland.
</p>

<p>
The first presbytery in the United States was formed about
1794, by the voluntary association of several ministers, who
had received Presbyterian orders in Europe, and who agreed
to govern themselves agreeably to the Westminster Confession
of Faith, Form of Government, Book of Discipline, and
Directory for Worship. (See
<hi rend='italic'><ref target='andover-orthodox-creed'>Andover Orthodox Creed</ref></hi>.)
</p>

<p>
The reason why the Presbyterians first settled in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and New Jersey, was undoubtedly this&mdash;that
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
in these places they found toleration, and equal religious
rights, while the Episcopacy was established by law in Virginia,
Congregationalism in New England, and the Reformed
Dutch church, with Episcopacy, in New York.
</p>

<p>
The doctrines of the Presbyterian church are Calvinistic;
and the only fundamental principle which distinguishes it
from other Protestant churches is this&mdash;that God has authorized
the government of his church by presbyters, or
elders, who are chosen by the people, and ordained to office
by predecessors in office, in virtue of the commission which
Christ gave his apostles as ministers in the kingdom of God;
and that, among all presbyters, there is an official parity,
whatever disparity may exist in their talents or official employments.
</p>

<p>
All the different congregations, under the care of the
general assembly, are considered as the one Presbyterian
church in the United States, meeting, for the sake of convenience
and edification, in their several places of worship.
Each particular congregation of baptized people, associated
for godly living, and the worship of Almighty God, may become
a Presbyterian church, by electing one or more elders,
agreeably to the form prescribed in the book styled the Constitution
of the Presbyterian Church, and having them ordained
and installed as their session.
</p>

<p>
They judge that to presbyteries the Lord Jesus has committed
the spiritual government of each particular congregation,
and not to the whole body of the communicants; and
on this point they are distinguished from Independents and
Congregationalists. If all were governors, they should not
be able to distinguish the overseers or bishops from all the
male and female communicants; nor could they apply the
command, <q>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
yourselves; for they watch for your souls, as they that
must give account.</q> (Heb. 13:17.) If all are rulers in the
church who are communicants, they are at a loss for the
meaning of the exhortation, <q>We beseech you, brethren, to
know them that labor among you, <emph>and are over you in the
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
Lord</emph>, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in
love for their work's sake.</q>
</p>

<p>
If an aggrieved brother should tell the story of his wrongs
to each individual communicant, he would not thereby tell it
to the church judicially, so that cognizance could be taken
of the affair. It is to the church, acting by her proper organs,
and to her overseers, met as a judicatory, that he must
bring his charge, if he would have discipline exercised in
such a way as God empowered his church to exercise it.
</p>

<p>
The general assembly is the highest judicatory in the
Presbyterian church, and is constituted by an equal number
of teaching and ruling elders, elected by each presbytery annually,
and specially commissioned to deliberate, vote, and
determine, in all matters which may come before that body.
Each presbytery may send one bishop and one ruling elder
to the assembly: each presbytery, having more than twelve
ministers, may send two ministers and two ruling elders, and
so, in the same proportion, for every twelve ministerial
members.
</p>

<p>
Every Presbyterian church elects its own pastor; but, to
secure the whole church against insufficient, erroneous, or
immoral men, it is provided that no church shall prosecute
any call, without first obtaining leave from the presbytery
under whose care that church may be; and that no licentiate,
or bishop, shall receive any call, but through the hands
of his own presbytery.
</p>

<p>
Any member of the Presbyterian church may be the subject
of its discipline; and every member, if he judges himself
injured by any portion of the church, may, by appeal, or
complaint, carry his cause up from the church session to the
presbytery, from the presbytery to the synod, and from the
synod to the general assembly, so as to obtain the decision
of the whole church, met by representation in this high
judicatory.
</p>

<p>
Evangelical ministers of the gospel, of all denominations,
are permitted, on the invitation of a pastor, or of the session
of a vacant church, to preach in their pulpits; and any person
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
known properly, or made known to a pastor or session,
as a communicant in good, regular standing, in any truly
Christian denomination of people, is, in most of their
churches, affectionately invited to occasional communion.
They wish to have Christian fellowship with all the redeemed
of the Lord, who have been renewed by his Spirit; but, in
ecclesiastical government and discipline, they ask and expect
the coöperation of none but Presbyterians. See

<head>Cumberland Presbyterians.</head>

<p>
In the year 1800, a very great revival of religion took
place within the bounds of the synod of Kentucky, in consequence
of which, a greater number of new congregations
were formed than it was possible to supply with regularly-educated
ministers. To remedy this evil, it was resolved to
license men to preach who were apt to teach, and sound in
the faith, though they had not gone through any course of
classical study. This took place at the Transylvania presbyter;
but, as many of its members were dissatisfied with the
proposed innovation, an appeal was made to the synod, which
appointed a commission to examine into the circumstances
of the case, the result of whose report was, a prohibition of
the labors of uneducated ministers, which led the opposite
party to form themselves into an independent presbytery,
which took its name from the district of Cumberland, in
which it was constituted.
</p>

<p>
As to the doctrinal views, they occupy a kind of middle
ground between Calvinists and Arminians. They reject the
doctrine of eternal reprobation, and hold the universality of
redemption, and that the Spirit of God operates on the
world, or as coëxtensively as Christ has made the atonement,
in such a manner as to leave all men inexcusable.
</p>

<p>
The Cumberland Presbyterians have about 550 churches
and ministers, and about 70,000 members. They have a
college at Cumberland, Ky.

<head>Episcopalians.</head>

<p>
That form of Church polity, in which the ministry is divided
into the three orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
each having powers and duties, distinct from the others, the
Bishops being superior to the Priests and Deacons, and the
immediate source of all their authority, is called <hi rend='smallcaps'>Episcopacy</hi>,
and those who adhere to this polity, are called <hi rend='smallcaps'>Episcopalians</hi>.
</p>

<p>
It is believed, by Episcopalians, that the Savior, when
upon earth, established a Church, or Society, of which He
was the Ruler and Head, and with which He promised to be,
till the end of the world. They believe, that, during the
forty days in which He remained upon earth, after His resurrection,
<q>speaking</q> to His disciples <q>of the things pertaining
to the kingdom of God,</q> He gave them such directions
for the government and management of this Society, or
Church, as were necessary; which directions, they implicitly
followed: and that, from their subsequent practice, these
directions of the Savior, whatever they may have been, are
to be ascertained.
</p>

<p>
<q>That it was the design of our blessed Redeemer to continue
a ministry in the Church, after His ascension, is a
truth, for which we ask no better proof, than that furnished
by the narratives of the Evangelists, and the practice of the
Apostles. If, then, a ministry, divinely authorized, was to
exist, it is equally evident, that it would assume some definite
form. It would consist, either of a single grade of office, in
which every person ordained would have an equal share in its
functions and prerogatives; or, of two, three, or more grades,
distinguished from each other by degrees of authority and
peculiarities of duty.</q> There must, also, exist, <emph>somewhere</emph>,
the power of transmitting the ministry, by ordination.
Among those, who suppose there is but one grade of
office, this power is lodged in every minister. By Episcopalians,
the power is confined to the highest order of the
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
ministry,&mdash;the Bishops. It is evident, that the Savior
could not have established both these different modes;
and therefore both cannot possibly be correct. <q>To suppose,
that He, who is the Fountain of all wisdom, could have
been the Author of such inevitable disorder,&mdash;a kind of disorder
which must ever keep the axe at the root of that <emph>unity</emph>
for which He prayed,&mdash;is not only an absurdity, but an
opinion equally repudiated by all parties.</q> <q>It is manifest,</q>
therefore, <q>that whatever may prove itself to be <hi rend='smallcaps'>the</hi> form of
ministry, established and authorized by Jesus Christ, every
other must be altogether void of such authority, and based
simply on human appointment.</q>
</p>

<p>
That this Church, or Society, might endure, it must be
provided with a well-arranged organization, or form of government,
and consist of officers and members. No society
can exist, without this; and the powers and duties of the
officers should be well defined, and so adjusted, as to promote,
in the best manner, the permanent good of the society.
That this Society might endure forever, some provision must
be made for the renewal of its officers, so that, when any
were taken away, by death, their places might be supplied
with suitable successors. That the Savior made all necessary
provision for these purposes, there can be no doubt;
and that the organization which He directed His Apostles to
establish, was Episcopal, is easily susceptible of proof.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the Bible, different orders in the ministry are
recognized or referred to. Under the Jewish dispensation,
(which, be it remembered, was established by God Himself,)
there were the three orders of High Priest, Priests, and Levites.
When the Savior was upon earth, He was the visible
head of the Church,&mdash;the <q>Bishop and Shepherd of our
souls,</q>&mdash;and the Apostles and seventy Disciples were the other
two orders. After his ascension, the Apostles became the
visible heads of the Church, the lower orders being Bishops,
(called also Priests or Presbyters, and Elders,) and Deacons.
When the Apostles were called hence, their successors did
not assume the name or title of Apostle, but took that of
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
Bishop, which thenceforth was applied exclusively to the
highest order of the ministry, the other two orders being the
Presbyters (Priests or Elders) and Deacons. Thus it has
continued to the present day.
</p>

<p>
It is worthy of remark, that <q>early writers have been careful
to record the ecclesiastical genealogy or succession of the
Bishops, in several of the principal Churches. Thus, we
have catalogues of the Bishops of Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome,
&amp;c.; though it does not appear that the Presbyters and
Deacons of those Churches were honored with any similar
notice.</q> In like manner, catalogues of temporal Rulers are
preserved, when the names of officers subordinate to them
are suffered to pass into oblivion. It is easy to trace back
the line of Bishops, by name, from our own day, up to the
Apostles themselves.
</p>

<p>
There is no ancient writer on ecclesiastical matters, who
does not speak of the division of the ministry into different and
distinct Orders, and of certain individuals as Bishops of particular
Churches; or who mentions, as existing at the same
time, and in the same Churches, any other persons by the
same name of Bishops.
</p>

<p>
But, it is to be observed, that it is not only necessary that
a Church should preserve the true Order in the Ministry, but
also that it retain the true faith. For a true faith and true
Order are both necessary to constitute a Church. All the
heretical sects of the ancient Church had the Apostolic Ministry;
but, when they departed from the true faith, they were
excluded from the communion of the Church. <q>The Arians,
the Donatists, the Novatians, &amp;c. &amp;c., were all Episcopal in
their Ministry, and in this respect differed in nothing from
the Orthodox Catholic Church. Their grand error lay in the
want of that union of Order <emph>and</emph> Faith, which are essential
to the being of a Church.</q>
</p>

<p>
An external commission, conveyed by Episcopal consecration
or ordination, is considered necessary to constitute a
lawful ministry; and it is therefore declared, by the Church,
that <q>no man shall be accounted or taken to be a lawful
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, in this Church, or suffered to execute
any of said functions,</q> unless he has <q>had Episcopal
consecration or ordination;</q> and the power of ordaining, or
setting apart to the ministry, and of laying on hands upon
others, is vested in the Bishops.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>ministry</emph> is of Divine appointment, and consists of
three orders, only,&mdash;Bishop, Priest, and Deacon. The <emph>government</emph>
is of human regulation, and may be modified as circumstances
require. Other officers may be appointed, and
the manner in which ministers are invested with their jurisdiction
may be varied. To use the language of the Episcopal
Church in the United States, in the Preface to her Book of
Common Prayer, <q>It is a most invaluable part of that
blessed liberty, wherewith Christ hath made us free, that, in
His worship, different forms and usages may, without offence,
be allowed, provided the substance of the faith be kept entire;
and that, in every Church, what cannot be clearly determined
to belong to Doctrine, must be referred to Discipline; and
therefore, by common consent and authority, may be altered,
abridged, enlarged, amended, or otherwise disposed of, as
may seem most convenient for the edification of the people,
<q>according to the various exigencies of times and occasions.</q> ...
The particular Forms of Divine Worship, and the
Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be used therein, being
things in their own nature indifferent and alterable, and so
acknowledged, it is but reasonable, that, upon weighty and
important considerations, according to the various exigencies
of times and occasions, such changes and alterations should be
made therein, as to those, who are in places of authority
should, from time to time, seem either necessary or expedient.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the Church of England, there are Archbishops, Deans,
and various other officers and titles of office; but these are
of local authority, and do not interfere with the three Divinely-appointed
orders. To use the language of Hooker, <q>I
may securely, therefore, conclude, that there are, at this day,
in the Church of England, no other than the same degrees
of ecclesiastical orders, namely, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
which had their beginning from Christ and His blessed
Apostles themselves. As for Deans, Prebendaries, Parsons,
Vicars, Curates, Archdeacons, and such like names, being
not found in the Scriptures, we have been thereby, through
some men's errors, thought to allow ecclesiastical degrees
not known nor ever heard of in the better ages of former
times. All these are in truth but titles of office,</q> admitted
<q>as the state of the Church doth need, degrees of order still
remaining the same as they were from the beginning.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two hundred years ago, Hooker gave the following challenge,
which has never yet been accepted:&mdash;<q>We require
you to find but one Church upon the face of the whole earth
that hath not been ordered by Episcopal regiment since the
time that the blessed Apostles were here conversant.</q> And
though, says Bishop Doane, departures from it, since the
time of which he spoke, have been but too frequent and too
great, <q>Episcopal regiment</q> is still maintained as Christ's
ordinance, for the perpetuation and government of his Church,
and is received as such by eleven twelfths of the whole Christian
world. For a period of fifteen hundred years after the
Apostolic age, ordination by Presbyters was totally unknown,
except in a few crooked cases, where the attempt was made,
and followed by instant condemnation from the Church, and
the declaration that they were utterly null and void. There
was no ministry in existence, before the era of the Reformation,
but that which had come down direct from the Apostles,
that is, the Episcopal. This is admitted by nearly all
the opponents of Episcopacy.
</p>

<p>
The Episcopal Church in the United States, agrees with
that of England, in doctrine, discipline, and worship, with
some few unessential variations. Their Ritual, or Form of
Worship, is the same, except that some few parts have been
omitted for the sake of shortening the service, or for other
reasons. Changes became necessary in the prayers for Rulers,
in consequence of the independence of the United States.
</p>

<p>
The different Episcopal parishes in each of the United
States, (except in some of the newly-settled parts of the
<pb n='031'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>
Country, where two or more States are united for this purpose,)
are connected by a Constitution, which provides for a
convention of the clergy and lay delegates from each parish
in the State or Diocese. This Convention is held annually,
and regulates the local concerns of its own Diocese, the
Bishop of which, is the President of the Convention. The
Conventions of the different Dioceses elect Deputies to a
General Convention, which is held once in three years.
Each Diocese may elect four Clergymen and four Laymen,
as delegates, who, when assembled in General Convention,
form what is called the <q>House of Clerical and Lay Deputies,</q>
each Order from a Diocese having one vote, and the
concurrence of both being necessary to every act of the
Convention. The Bishops form a separate House, with a
right to originate measures for the concurrence of the House
of Clerical and Lay Deputies, each House having a negative
upon the other, as in the Congress of the United States.
The whole Church is governed by Canons, framed by the
General Convention. These Canons regulate the mode of
elections of Bishops, declare the age and qualifications necessary
for obtaining the orders of Deacon or Priest, the studies
to be previously pursued, the examinations which each candidate
is to undergo, and all other matters of permanent
legislation. Deacon's orders cannot be conferred on any person
under the age of twenty-one, nor those of Priest before that of
twenty-four. A Bishop must be at least thirty years of age.
Prejudices have prevailed against the Episcopal Church,
and probably still exist in the minds of some persons, from
an impression, that Episcopacy is not congenial with a republican
form of government, and the civil institutions of our
Country. But, that this is an erroneous opinion, will be evident,
to any one who will carefully and impartially examine
the subject. It will he seen, from what has been stated above,
that its Constitution is founded on the representative principle,
and is strikingly analogous to the form of government
of the United States. <q>In the <emph>permanent</emph> official stations of
the Bishops and Clergy in her legislative bodies, our own
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
Church,</q> says Bishop Hobart, <q>resembles all other religious
communities, whose clergy also are permanent legislators.
But, in some respects, she is more conformed than they are
to the organization of our civil governments. Of these, it is
a characteristic, that legislative power is divided between two
branches. And it is a peculiar character of our own Church,
that her legislative power is thus divided. Again, a single
responsible Executive characterizes our civil constitutions.
The same feature marks our own Church, in the single Episcopal
Executive in each Diocese, chosen, in the first instance,
by the Clergy and representatives of the Laity. Nor are
these the only points in which the Bishop of our Church may
feel pleasure in asserting the free and republican constitution
of our government; for, in our ecclesiastical judicatories, the
representatives of the laity possess strict coordinate authority,&mdash;the
power of voting as a separate body, and of annulling,
by a majority of votes, the acts of the Bishops and Clergy.</q>

<head>Historical Notice Of The Church In The United
States.</head>

<p>
Though the greater proportion of the early emigrants
to this Country were opposed to the form of religious
worship established in the Mother Country, some of them
were devoted adherents of that establishment, and Episcopal
churches existed, of course, in several of the Colonies,
at an early period, although, from the opposition made to them
by the other emigrants, and from other causes, the number
was not so considerable as might have been expected under
different circumstances. At the commencement of the Revolutionary
<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>
War, there were not more than eighty parochial
clergymen North and East of Maryland; and these, with the
exception of those in the towns of Boston and Newport, and
the cities of New York and Philadelphia, derived the principal
part of their support from England, through the <q>Society
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,</q> an old
and venerable Institution, yet in existence, and still zealously
engaged in spreading the Gospel to the utmost parts of the
earth. In Maryland and Virginia, the members of the
Church were much more numerous, than in the other
parts of the Country, and the clergy were supported by a
legal establishment.
</p>

<p>
The distance of this from the Mother Country, and the
consequent separation of the members of the Church from
their parent stock, which rendered them dependent for the
ministry upon emigrations from England, or obliged them to
send candidates to that Country, for Holy Orders, operated
as a serious obstacle to the increase of the Church here.
All the clergy of this Country were attached to the diocese
of the Bishop of London, who thus became the only bond of
union between them; but his authority could not be effectually
exerted, at such a distance, in those cases where it was
most needed; and, for these and other reasons, several efforts
were made by the clergy to obtain an American Episcopate.
But the jealousy with which such a measure was regarded by
other denominations, and the great opposition with which it
consequently met, prevented the accomplishment of the design.
When, however, the tie, which had thus bound the
members of the Church together in one communion, had
been severed, by the independence of the United States, it
was necessary that some new bond of union should be
adopted; and renewed efforts were made to procure an
Episcopate.
</p>

<p>
The clergy of the Church in Connecticut, at a meeting
held in March, 1783, elected the Rev. Samuel Seabury,
D. D., their Bishop, and sent him to England, with an application
to the Archbishop of Canterbury for his consecration
<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>
to that holy office. The English Bishops were unable to
consecrate him, till an Act of Parliament, authorizing them so
to do, could be passed; and he then made application to the
Bishops of the Church in Scotland, who readily assented to
the request, and he was consecrated by them, in Aberdeen,
on the 14th of November, 1784. The Prelates, who were
thus the instruments of first communicating the Episcopate
to this Country, were, the Right Reverend Robert Kilgour,
D. D., Bishop of Aberdeen, the Right Reverend Arthur
Petrie, D. D., Bishop of Ross and Moray, and the Right
Reverend John Skinner, D. D., Coadjutor Bishop of Aberdeen.
Bishop Seabury returned to this Country, immediately
after his consecration, and commenced his Episcopal duties
without delay.
</p>

<p>
A few clergymen of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,
having held a meeting at Brunswick, N. J., on the
13th and 14th of May, 1784, for the purpose of consulting
in what way to renew a Society for the support of widows
and children of deceased clergymen, determined to procure
a larger meeting on the 5th of the ensuing October, not only
for the purpose of completing the object for which they had
then assembled, but also to confer and agree on some general
principles of a union of the Church throughout the
States. At this latter meeting, a plan of ecclesiastical union
was agreed upon, with great unanimity; and a recommendation
to the several States, to send delegates to a general
meeting, at Philadelphia, in September, 1785, was adopted.
</p>

<p>
At the meeting, in Philadelphia, in September and October,
1785, there were present, deputies from seven of the
thirteen States. This Convention framed an Ecclesiastical
Constitution, recommended sundry alterations in the Book
of Common Prayer, to adapt it to the local circumstances
of the Country, now severed from the parent State, and
also took some measures towards procuring the Episcopate
from England. An Address was forwarded to the English
Bishops, through his Excellency John Adams, then Minister
to England, and afterwards President of the United States
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
who zealously used his influence to promote the views of the
Convention.
</p>

<p>
Another Convention was held in Philadelphia, in June,
1786, at which, a Letter was read, from the Archbishops and
Bishops of England, in answer to the Address forwarded
from the preceding Convention; and another Address to the
same Right Reverend Prelates, was adopted, to accompany
the Ecclesiastical Constitution now finally agreed upon.
This Convention then adjourned, to meet again whenever
answers should be received from England. The next meeting
was held at Wilmington, in Delaware, in October, 1786,
at which, Letters from the English Prelates were read, and
also an Act of Parliament, authorizing the consecration of
Bishops for foreign places. Sundry further amendments and
modifications of the Ecclesiastical Constitution, and Book of
Common Prayer, were agreed upon, another Address to the
English Prelates was adopted, and testimonials signed for
three clergymen, who had been elected Bishops by their
respective Dioceses. Two of these clergymen proceeded to
England, in the course of the next month; and, after some
further delays, all difficulties were finally removed, and the
Rev. William White, D. D., of Philadelphia, and the Rev.
Samuel Provoost, D. D., of New York, having been elected
to the Bishoprics of Pennsylvania and New York, were
consecrated to their high and holy office, on the fourth of
February, A. D. 1787, in the chapel of the Archiepiscopal
palace at Lambeth, by the Most Reverend John Moore,
D. D., Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Most Reverend
William Markham, D. D., Archbishop of York, the
Right Reverend Charles Moss, D. D., Bishop of Bath and
Wells, and the Right Reverend Charles Hinchliff, D. D.,
Bishop of Peterborough. The newly-consecrated Bishops
returned to America, April 7, 1787, and soon after, began
the exercise of their Episcopal functions in their respective
dioceses.
</p>

<p>
Of these three original Bishops of the Church, Bishop Seabury
discharged his Episcopal duties between nine and ten
<pb n='036'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>
years, and died, February 25, 1796. Bishop White continued
to be as a patriarch of the Church for many years, his
life having been prolonged to the age of 88, and the discharge
of his Episcopal functions having continued forty-nine
years. He died, July 17, 1836. Bishop Provoost died, September
6, 1815, in the twenty-ninth year of his Episcopate.
</p>

<p>
The first triennial Convention of the Church was held in
July and August, 1789, and the sessions of this body continue
to be regularly held every three years. Rev. James Madison,
D. D., was consecrated Bishop of Virginia, by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, September 19, 1790, and died March 6, 1812.
Rev. Thomas John Claggett, D. D., of Maryland, was the first
Bishop consecrated in the United States, having been elevated
to that holy Order by the Right Reverend Bishops Provoost,
Seabury, White, and Madison, in New York, September
17, 1792; since which time, thirty-three Bishops have been
consecrated, making the whole number, thirty-eight, of whom
twenty are now living. For the succession of Bishops, from
the first establishment of the Church, to the present day, see
<hi rend='italic'><ref target='statistics-episcopalians'>Statistics</ref></hi>.
</p>

<p>
The last General Convention was held in New York, in
October, 1841, at which time, there were present, twenty-one
Bishops, and 79 clerical and 57 lay members. The
Bishops reported the consecration of 93 churches, the ordination
of 355 clergymen, and the confirmation of 14,767
persons, in the years 1838 to 1841. The whole number of
clergymen, at the present time, (1842,) is 1114. Other facts

</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. VII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Old Testament.</hi>&mdash;The Old Testament
is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New
Testament, everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who
is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God
and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign,
that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises
<pb n='039'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>
Although the law given from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies
and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil
precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any
commonwealth; yet, notwithstanding, no Christian man
whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments
which are called Moral.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. VIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Creeds.</hi>&mdash;The Nicene Creed, and
that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought
thoroughly to be received and believed; for they may be
proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. IX.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Original or Birth-Sin.</hi>&mdash;Original sin
standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
vainly talk,) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature
of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of
Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness,
and is, of his own nature, inclined to evil, so that the
flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit; and therefore, in
every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath
and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain,
yea, in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the
flesh, called in Greek, <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>Phronema sarkos</foreign>,
which some do expound
the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some
the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the law of God. And
although there is no condemnation for them that believe and
are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence
and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. X.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Free Will.</hi>&mdash;The condition of man, after
the fall of Adam, is such, that he cannot turn and prepare
himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith,
and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do
good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the
grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a
good will, and working with us, when we have that good
will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Justification of Man.</hi>&mdash;We are accounted
righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works
<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>
or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by faith only,
is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort, as
more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Good Works.</hi>&mdash;Albeit that good works,
which are the fruits of faith, and follow after justification,
cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's
judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in
Christ, and do spring out, necessarily, of a true and lively
faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently
known, as a tree discerned by the fruit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Works before Justification.</hi>&mdash;Works
done before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his
Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not
of faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make men meet to
receive grace, or (as the school authors say) deserve grace
of congruity; yea, rather, for that they are not done as God
hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not
but they have the nature of sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XIV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Works of Supererogation.</hi>&mdash;Voluntary
works, besides over and above God's commandments, which
they call works of supererogation, cannot be taught without
arrogancy and impiety; for by them men do declare, that
they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound
to do, but that they do more for His sake than of bounden duty
is required; whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have
done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable
servants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Christ alone without Sin.</hi>&mdash;Christ, in
the truth of our nature, was made like unto us in all things,
sin only except, from which He was clearly void, both in His
flesh and in His spirit. He came to be a Lamb without spot,
who, by sacrifice of Himself once made, should take away the
sins of the world; and sin (as Saint John saith) was not in
Him. But all we the rest (although baptized and born again
in Christ) yet offend in many things; and if we say we have
no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XVI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Sin after Baptism.</hi>&mdash;Not every deadly
<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>
sin willingly committed after baptism, is sin against the
Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance
is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after baptism.
After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may
depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace
of God (we may) arise again, and amend our lives. And
therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no
more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness
to such as truly repent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XVII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Predestination and Election.</hi>&mdash;Predestination
to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby
(before the foundations of the world were laid) He hath constantly
decreed, by His counsel, secret to us, to deliver from
curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ
out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting
salvation, as vessels made to honor. Wherefore they, which
be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according
to God's purpose by His Spirit working in due
season: they, through grace, obey the calling: they be justified
freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be
made like the image of His only begotten Son Jesus Christ,
they walk religiously in good works; and at length, by God's
mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As the godly consideration of predestination, and our
election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable
comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves
the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of
the flesh and their earthly members, and drawing up their
mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth
greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation,
to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently
kindle their love towards God; so, for curious and carnal
persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before
their eyes the sentence of God's predestination, is a most
dangerous downfall, whereby the devil doth thrust them
either into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean
living, no less perilous than desperation.</q>
</p>

<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such
wise as they be generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture
and, in our doings, that will of God is to be followed, which
we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XVIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by
the Name of Christ.</hi>&mdash;They also are to be had accursed,
that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the law
or sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame
his life according to that law, and the light of nature. For
Holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus
Christ, whereby men must be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XIX.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Church.</hi>&mdash;The visible Church of
Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the which the
pure Word of God is preached, and the sacraments be duly
ministered according to Christ's ordinance, in all those
things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As the Church of Hierusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch,
have erred, so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only
in their living and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters
of faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XX.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Authority of the Church.</hi>&mdash;The
Church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority
in controversies of faith; and yet it is not lawful for
the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's
Word written; neither may it so expound one place of
Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although
the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ,
yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so
besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed
for necessity of salvation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Authority of General Councils.</hi></q><note place='foot'>The
21st of the former Articles is omitted, because it is partly of a
local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the remaining parts of
it, in other Articles.</note>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Purgatory.</hi>&mdash;The Romish doctrine
concerning purgatory, pardons, worshipping, and adoration,
as well of images as of reliques, and also invocation of
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon
no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word
of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Ministering in the Congregation.</hi>&mdash;It
is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of
public preaching, or ministering the sacraments in the Congregation,
before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute
the same. And those we ought to judge lawfully called and
sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who
have public authority given unto them in the Congregation,
to call and send ministers into the Lord's vineyard.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXIV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Speaking in the Congregation in such
a Tongue as the People understandeth.</hi>&mdash;It is a thing plainly
repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the
primitive Church, to have public prayer in the Church, or to
minister the sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the
people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Sacraments.</hi>&mdash;Sacraments ordained
of Christ, be not only badges or tokens of Christian
men's profession; but rather they be certain sure witnesses,
and effectual signs of grace, and God's good will toward us,
by the which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only
quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith in Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord
in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the
Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Those five commonly called sacraments, that is to say,
Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme
Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel,
being such as have grown, partly of the corrupt fallowing of
the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed by the Scriptures;
but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism
and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible
sign or ceremony ordained of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed
upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use
them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
have a wholesome effect or operation; but they that receive
them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint
Paul saith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXVI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers,
which hinders not the Effect of the Sacraments.</hi>&mdash;Although
in the visible Church, the evil be ever mingled with the
good, and sometime the evil have chief authority in the ministration
of the Word and Sacraments; yet, forasmuch as
they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and
do minister by his commission and authority, we may use
their ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in
receiving the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's
ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of
God's gifts diminished from such as, by faith, and rightly, do
receive the Sacraments ministered unto them, which be effectual,
because of Christ's institution and promise, although
they be ministered by evil men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the
Church, that inquiry be made of evil ministers, and that they
be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences;
and finally, being found guilty, by just judgment, be deposed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXVII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Baptism.</hi>&mdash;Baptism is not only a
sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian
men are discerned from others that be not christened; but it
is also a sign of regeneration, or new birth, whereby, as by
an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted
into the Church: the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and
of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost,
are visibly signed and sealed: faith is confirmed, and grace
increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of
young children is in any wise to be retained in the Church,
as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXVIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Lord's Supper.</hi>&mdash;The Supper
of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians
ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather
it is a Sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death: insomuch
that, to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of
the body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a
partaking of the blood of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of
bread and wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved
by Holy Writ; but it is repugnant to the plain words of
Scripture, overthrowing the nature of a sacrament, and hath
given occasion to many superstitions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the
Supper, only after a heavenly and spiritual manner. And
the mean, whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten
in the Supper, is faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's
ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXIX.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Wicked, which eat not of the
Body of Christ in the Use of the Lord's Supper.</hi>&mdash;The wicked,
and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do
carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine
saith) the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ;
yet in nowise are they partakers of Christ; but rather, to
their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or sacrament
of so great a thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXX.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Both Kinds.</hi>&mdash;The Cup of the Lord
is not to be denied to the lay people; for both the parts of the
Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,
ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the one Oblation of Christ finished
upon the Cross.</hi>&mdash;The offering of Christ once made, is that
perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the
sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there
is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore
the sacrifice of masses, in the which it was commonly said,
that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to
have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables,
and dangerous deceits.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Marriage of Priests.</hi>&mdash;Bishops,
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's law
either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from
marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other
Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they
shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of excommunicate Persons, how they
are to be avoided.</hi>&mdash;That person which, by open denunciation
of the Church, is rightly cut off from the unity of the
Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken, of the
whole multitude of the faithful, as a heathen and publican,
until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into
the Church by a judge that hath authority thereunto.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXIV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Traditions of the Church.</hi>&mdash;It
is not necessary that traditions and ceremonies be in all
places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been
divers, and may be changed according to the diversity of
countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be
ordained against God's Word. Whosoever, through his private
judgment, willingly and purposely doth openly break the
traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant
to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved
by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that
other may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against
the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority
of the magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the
weak brethren.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain,
change, and abolish ceremonies or rites of the Church,
ordained only by man's authority, so that all things be done
to edifying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXV.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Homilies.</hi>&mdash;The second Book of
Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined, under
this article, doth contain a godly and wholesome doctrine,
and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of
Homilies, which were set forth in the time of Edward the
Sixth; and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches
<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>
by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be
understanded of the people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Of
the Names of the Homilies.</hi>&mdash;1. Of the right Use of
the Church. 2. Against Peril of Idolatry. 3. Of repairing
and keeping clean of Churches. 4. Of Good Works;
first of Fasting. 5. Against Gluttony and Drunkenness.
6. Against Excess of Apparel. 7. Of Prayer. 8. Of the
Place and Time of Prayer. 9. That Common Prayers and
Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known Tongue.
10. Of the reverent Estimation of God's Word. 11. Of

</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>[This article is received in this Church, so far as it declares
the Books of Homilies to be an explication of Christian
doctrine, and instructive in piety and morals. But all
references to the constitution and laws of England are considered
as inapplicable to the circumstances of this Church,
which also suspends the order for the reading of said Homilies
in Churches, until a revision of them may be conveniently
made, for the clearing of them, as well from obsolete
words and phrases, as from the local references.]</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXVI.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.</hi>&mdash;The
Book of Consecration of Bishops, and Ordering
of Priests and Deacons, as set forth by the General
Convention of this Church, in 1792, doth contain all things
necessary to such consecration and ordering; neither hath it
any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and ungodly: and,
therefore, whosoever are consecrated or ordered according
to said form, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and
lawfully, consecrated and ordered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXVII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of the Power of the Civil Magistrates.</hi>&mdash;The
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
power of the civil magistrate extendeth to all
men, as well clergy as laity, in all things temporal; but hath
no authority in things purely spiritual. And we hold it to
be the duty of all men, who are professors of the Gospel, to
pay respectful obedience to the civil authority, regularly and
legitimately constituted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Art. XXXVIII.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Of Christian Men's Goods which are
not common.</hi>&mdash;The riches and goods of Christians are not
common, as touching the right, title, and possession, of the
same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast. Notwithstanding,
every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally
to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.</q>

<hi rend='italic'>Of a Christian Man's Oath.</hi>&mdash;As we
confess that vain, and rash swearing is forbidden Christian
men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle; so we

faith and charity, so it be done according to the prophet's
teaching, in justice, judgment, and truth.</q>

The Cambridge Platform of church government, and the

The form of church government, however, embraced in

<head>Moravians, Or United Brethren.</head>

<p>
A name given to the followers of Nicholas Lewis, count
of Zinzendorf, who, in the year 1721, settled at Bartholdorf,
in Upper Lusatia. There he made proselytes of two or three
Moravian families, and, having engaged them to leave their
country, received them at Bartholdorf, in Germany. They
were directed to build a house in a wood, about half a league
from that village, where, in 1722, this people held their first
meeting.
</p>

<p>
This society increased so fast, that, in a few years, they
had an orphan-house and other public buildings. An adjacent
hill, called the Huth-Berg, gave the colonists occasion
to call this dwelling-place Herrnhut, which may be interpreted
<hi rend='italic'>the guard</hi> or
<hi rend='italic'>protection of the Lord</hi>. Hence this
society are sometimes called <hi rend='italic'>Herrnhuters</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The Moravians avoid discussions respecting the speculative
truths of religion, and insist upon individual experience
of the practical efficiency of the gospel in producing a real
change of sentiment and conduct, as the only essentials in
religion. They consider the manifestation of God in Christ
as intended to be the most beneficial revelation of the Deity
to the human race; and, in consequence, they make the life,
merits, acts, words, sufferings, and death, of the Savior the
principal theme of their doctrine, while they carefully avoid
entering into any theoretical disquisitions on the mysterious
essence of the Godhead, simply adhering to the words of
Scripture. Admitting the sacred Scriptures as the only
source of divine revelation, they nevertheless believe that the
Spirit of God continues to lead those who believe in Christ
into all further truth, not by revealing new doctrines, but by
teaching those who sincerely desire to learn, daily, better to
understand and apply the truths which the Scriptures contain.
They believe that, to live agreeably to the gospel, it
<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>
is essential to aim, in all things, to fulfil the will of God.
Even in their temporal concerns, they endeavor to ascertain
the will of God. They do not, indeed, expect some miraculous
manifestation of his will, but only endeavor to test the
purity of their purposes by the light of the divine word.
Nothing of consequence is done by them, as a society, until
such an examination has taken place; and, in cases of difficulty,
the question is decided by lot, to avoid the undue
preponderance of influential men, and in the humble hope
that God will guide them right by its decision, where their
limited understanding fails them. In former times, the marriages
of the members of the society were, in some respects,
regarded as a concern of the society, as it was part of their
social agreement that none should take place without the
approval of the elders; and the elders' consent or refusal was
usually determined by lot. But this custom was at length abandoned;
and nothing is now requisite to obtain the consent
of the elders, but propriety of conduct in the parties. They
consider none of their peculiar regulations essential, but all
liable to be altered or abandoned, whenever it is found
necessary, in order better to attain their great object&mdash;the
promotion of piety.
</p>

<p>
What characterizes the Moravians most, and holds them
up to the attention of others, is their missionary zeal. In
this they are superior to any other body of people in the
world. <q>Their missionaries,</q> as one observes, <q>are all of
them volunteers; for it is an inviolable maxim with them to
<emph>persuade</emph> no man to engage in missions. They are all of
one mind as to the doctrines they teach, and seldom make an
attempt where there are not half a dozen of them in the mission.
Their zeal is calm, steady, persevering. They would reform
the world, but are careful how they quarrel with it. They
carry their point by address, and the insinuations of modesty
and mildness, which commend them to all men, and give
offence to none. The habits of silence, quietness, and decent
reserve, mark their character.</q>
</p>

<p>
The following is a sketch of the mode of life of the Moravians,
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
or United Brethren, where they form separate communities,
which, however, is not always the case; for, in many
instances, societies belonging to the Unity are situated in
larger and smaller cities and towns, intermingled with the
rest of the inhabitants, in which cases their peculiar regulations
are, of course, out of the question. In their separate
communities, they do not allow the permanent residence of
any persons as householders who are not members in full
communion, and who have not signed the written instrument
of brotherly agreement, upon which their constitution and
discipline rest; but they freely admit of the temporary residence
among them of such other persons as are willing to
conform to their external regulations. According to these,
all kinds of amusements considered dangerous to strict
morality are forbidden, as balls, dancing, plays, gambling of
any kind, and all promiscuous assemblies of youth of both
sexes. These, however, are not debarred from forming,
under proper advice and parental superintendence, that acquaintance
which their future matrimonial connections may
require. In the communities on the European continent,
whither, to this day, numbers of young persons of both sexes
resort, in order to become members of the society from motives
of piety and a desire to prepare themselves to become
missionaries among the heathen, and where, moreover, the
difficulties of supporting a family greatly limit the number of
marriages, a stricter attention to this point becomes necessary.
On this account, the unmarried men and boys, not belonging
to the families of the community, reside together, under the
care of an elder of their own class, in a building called the
<hi rend='italic'>single brethren's house</hi>, where usually divers trades and
manufactures are carried on, for the benefit of the house or
of the community, and which, at the same time, furnishes a
cheap and convenient place for the board and lodging of
those who are employed as journeymen, apprentices, or
otherwise, in the families constituting the community.
Particular daily opportunities of edification are there afforded
them; and such a house is the place of resort where the
<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>
young men and boys of the families spend their leisure time,
it being a general rule, that every member of the society
shall devote himself to some useful occupation. A similar
house, under the guidance of a female superintendent, and
under similar regulations, is called the <hi rend='italic'>single sisters' house</hi>,
and is the common dwelling-place of all unmarried females,
not members of any family, or not employed as servants in
the families of the community. Even these regard the
sisters' house as their principal place of association at leisure
hours. Industrious habits are here inculcated in the same
way. In the communities of the United Brethren in America,
the facilities of supporting families, and the consequent
early marriages, have superseded the necessity of single
brethren's houses; but they all have sisters' houses of the
above description, which afford a comfortable asylum to aged
unmarried females, while they furnish an opportunity of attending
to the further education and improvement of the
female youth after they have left school. In the larger communities,
similar houses afford the same advantages to such
widows as desire to live retired, and are called <hi rend='italic'>widows' houses</hi>.
The individuals residing in these establishments pay a small
rent, by which, and by the sums paid for their board, the
expenses of these houses are defrayed, assisted occasionally
by the profits on the sale of ornamental needle-work, &amp;c.,
on which some of the inmates subsist. The aged and needy
are supported by the same means. Each division of sex and
station just alluded to, viz., widows, single men and youths,
single women and girls past the age of childhood, is placed
under the special guidance of elders of their own description,
whose province it is to assist them with good advice and
admonition, and to attend, as much as may be, to the spiritual
and temporal welfare of each individual. The children of
each sex are under the immediate care of the superintendent
of the single choirs, as these divisions are termed. Their
instruction in religion, and in all the necessary branches of
human knowledge, in good schools, carried on separately for
each sex, is under the special superintendence of the stated
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
minister of each community, and of the board of elders.
Similar special elders are charged to attend to the spiritual
welfare of the married people. All these elders, of both
sexes, together with the stated minister, to whom the preaching
of the gospel is chiefly committed, (although all other
elders who may be qualified participate therein,) and with the
persons to whom the economical concerns of the community
are intrusted, form together the board of elders, in which rests
the government of the community, with the concurrence of
the committee elected by the inhabitants for all temporal
concerns. This committee superintends the observance of
all regulations, has charge of the police, and decides differences
between individuals. Matters of a general nature are
submitted to a meeting of the whole community, consisting
either of all male members of age, or of an intermediate body
elected by them. Public meetings are held every evening in
the week. Some of these are devoted to the reading of the
Scriptures, others to the communication of accounts from
the missionary stations, and others to the singing of hymns
or selected verses. On Sunday mornings, the church litany
is publicly read, and sermons are delivered to the congregation,
which, in many places, is the case likewise in the
afternoon. In the evening, discourses are delivered, in
which the texts for that day are explained and brought home
to the particular circumstances of the community. Besides
these regular means of edification, the festival days of the
Christian church, such as Easter, Pentecost, Christmas, &amp;c.,
are commemorated in a special manner, as well as some days
of peculiar interest in the history of the society. A solemn
church music constitutes a prominent feature of their means
of edification, music in general being a favorite employment
of the leisure of many. On particular occasions, and before
the congregation meets to partake of the Lord's supper, they
assemble expressly to listen to instrumental and vocal music,
interspersed with hymns, in which the whole congregation
joins, while they partake together of a cup of coffee, tea, or
chocolate, and light cakes, in token of fellowship and
<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>
brotherly union. This solemnity is called a <hi rend='italic'>love-feast</hi>, and
is in imitation of the custom of the agapæ in the primitive
Christian churches. The Lord's supper is celebrated at
stated intervals, generally by all communicant members together,
under very solemn but simple rites.
</p>

<p>
Easter morning is devoted to a solemnity of a peculiar
kind. At sunrise, the congregation assembles in the graveyard;
a service, accompanied by music, is celebrated, expressive
of the joyful hopes of immortality and resurrection,
and a solemn commemoration is made of all who have, in
the course of the last year, departed this life from among
them, and <q>gone home to the Lord</q>&mdash;an expression they
often use to designate death.
</p>

<p>
Considering the termination of the present life no evil, but
the entrance upon an eternal state of bliss to the sincere
disciples of Christ, they desire to divest this event of all its
terrors. The decease of every individual is announced to
the community by solemn music from a band of instruments.
Outward appearances of mourning are discountenanced.
The whole congregation follows the bier to the graveyard,
(which is commonly laid out as a garden,) accompanied by a
band, playing the tunes of well-known verses, which express
the hopes of eternal life and resurrection; and the corpse is
deposited in the simple grave during the funeral service.
The preservation of the purity of the community is intrusted
to the board of elders and its different members, who are to
give instruction and admonition to those under their care,
and make a discreet use of the established church discipline.
In cases of immoral conduct, or flagrant disregard of the
regulations of the society, this discipline is resorted to. If
expostulations are not successful, offenders are for a time
restrained from participating in the holy communion, or
called before the committee. For pertinacious bad conduct,
or flagrant excesses, the culpable individual is dismissed from
the society. The ecclesiastical church officers, generally
speaking, are the bishops,&mdash;through whom the regular succession
of ordination, transmitted to the United Brethren through
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
the ancient church of the Bohemian and Moravian Brethren,
is preserved, and who alone are authorized to ordain ministers,
but possess no authority in the government of the
church, except such as they derive from some other office,
being, most frequently, the presidents of some board of
elders,&mdash;the civil seniors,&mdash;to whom, in subordination to the
board of elders of the Unity, belongs the management of the
external relations of the society,&mdash;the presbyters, or ordained
stated ministers of the communities, and the deacons.
The degree of deacon is the first bestowed upon young ministers
and missionaries, by which they are authorized to administer
the sacraments. Females, although elders among
their own sex, are never ordained; nor have they a vote in
the deliberations of the board of elders, which they attend
for the sake of information only.

The Moravians that first visited the United States, settled
at Savannah, Ga., in 1735.

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Tunkers.</head>

<p>
A denomination of Seventh-Day Baptists, which took its
rise in the year 1724. It was founded by a German, who,
weary of the world, retired to an agreeable solitude, within
sixty miles of Philadelphia, for the more free exercise of
religious contemplation. Curiosity attracted followers, and
his simple and engaging manners made them proselytes.
They soon settled a little colony, called Ephrata, in allusion
to the Hebrews, who used to sing psalms on the border of
the River Euphrates. This denomination seem to have obtained
their name from their baptizing their new converts by
plunging. They are also called <hi rend='italic'>Tumblers</hi>, from the manner
in which they perform baptism, which is by putting the person,
while kneeling, head first under water, so as to resemble
the motion of the body in the action of tumbling. They use
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
the trine immersion, with laying on the hands and prayer,
even when the person baptized is in the water. Their habit
seems to be peculiar to themselves, consisting of a long tunic
or coat, reaching down to their heels, with a sash or girdle
round the waist, and a cap or hood hanging from the shoulders.
They do not shave the head or beard.
</p>

<p>
The men and women have separate habitations and distinct
governments. For these purposes, they erected two
large wooden buildings, one of which is occupied by the
brethren, the other by the sisters, of the society; and in
each of them there is a banqueting-room, and an apartment
for public worship; for the brethren and sisters do not meet
together even at their devotions.
</p>

<p>
They used to live chiefly upon roots and other vegetables,
the rules of their society not allowing them flesh, except upon
particular occasions, when they hold what they call a love-feast;
at which time, the brethren and sisters dine together
in a large apartment, and eat mutton, but no other meat. In
each of their little cells they have a bench fixed, to serve the
purpose of a bed, and a small block of wood for a pillow.
They allow of marriages, but consider celibacy as a virtue.
</p>

<p>
The principal tenet of the Tunkers appears to be this&mdash;that
future happiness is only to be obtained by penance and
outward mortifications in this life, and that, as Jesus Christ,
by his meritorious sufferings, became the Redeemer of mankind
in general, so each individual of the human race, by a
life of abstinence and restraint, may work out his own salvation.
Nay, they go so far as to admit of works of supererogation,
and declare that a man may do much more than he
is in justice or equity obliged to do, and that his superabundant
works may, therefore, be applied to the salvation
of others.
</p>

<p>
This denomination deny the eternity of future punishments,
and believe that the dead have the gospel preached to
them by our Savior, and that the souls of the just are employed
to preach the gospel to those who have had no revelation
in this life. They suppose the Jewish Sabbath, sabbatical
<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>
year, and year of jubilee, are typical of certain periods
after the general judgment, in which the souls of those who
are not then admitted into happiness are purified from their
corruption. If any, within those smaller periods, are so far
humbled as to acknowledge the perfections of God, and to
own Christ as their only Savior, they are received to felicity;
while those who continue obstinate are reserved in torments,
until the grand period, typified by the jubilee, arrives, in which
all shall be made happy in the endless fruition of the Deity.
</p>

<p>
They also deny the imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity.
They disclaim violence, even in cases of self-defence,
and suffer themselves to be defrauded, or wronged, rather
than go to law.
</p>

<p>
Their church government and discipline are the same with
other Baptists; except that every brother is allowed to speak
in the congregation; and their best speaker is usually ordained
to be the minister. They have deacons and deaconesses
from among their ancient widows and exhorters, who
are all licensed to use their gifts statedly.
</p>

<p>
The Tunkers are not so rigid in their dress and manner
of life as formerly; still they retain the faith of their fathers,
and lead lives of great industry, frugality, and purity.

<head>Mennonites, Or Harmless Christians.</head>

<p>
The Mennonites derive their name from Menno Simons,
an illustrious reformer. This people came to the United
States from Holland, and first settled in Pennsylvania, where
a large body of them now reside.
</p>

<p>
It is a universal maxim of this denomination, that practical
piety is the essence of religion, and that the surest mark of
the true church is the sanctity of its members. They all
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
unite in pleading for toleration in religion, and debar none
from their assemblies who lead pious lives, and own the
Scriptures for the word of God. They teach that infants
are not the proper subjects of baptism; that ministers of the
gospel ought to receive no salary; and that it is not lawful
to swear, or wage war, upon any occasion. They also maintain
that the terms <hi rend='italic'>person</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Trinity</hi> are not to be used in
speaking of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p>
The Mennonites meet privately, and every one in the assembly
has the liberty to speak, to expound the Scriptures, to
pray, and sing.
</p>

<p>
The Mennonites do not baptize by immersion, though they
administer the ordinance to none but adult persons. Their
common method is this: The person who is to be baptized,
kneels; the minister holds his hands over him, into which the
deacon pours water, and through which it runs on the crown
of the kneeling person's head; after which follow imposition
of hands and prayer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Van Beuning, the Dutch ambassador, speaking of
these <hi rend='italic'>Harmless Christians</hi>, as they choose to call themselves,
says, <q>The Mennonites are good people, and the most commodious
to a state of any in the world; partly, because they
do not aspire to places of dignity; partly, because they edify
the community by the simplicity of their manners, and application
to arts and industry; and partly, because we fear no
rebellion from a sect who make it an article of their faith
never to bear arms.</q>

<head>Disciples Of Christ; Sometimes Called Campbellites, or Reformers.</head>

<p>
The rise of this society, if we only look back to the
drawing of the lines of demarkation between it and other
professors, is of recent origin. About the commencement
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
of the present century, the Bible alone, without any human
addition in the form of creeds or confessions of faith, began
to be preached by many distinguished ministers of different
denominations, both in Europe and America.
</p>

<p>
With various success, and with many of the opinions of
the various sects imperceptibly carried with them from the
denominations to which they once belonged, did the advocates
of the Bible cause plead for the union of Christians of every
name, on the broad basis of the apostles' teaching. But it
was not until the year 1823, that a restoration of the <emph>original
gospel</emph> and <emph>order of things</emph> began to be advocated in a periodical,
edited by Alexander Campbell, of Bethany, Virginia, entitled
<q>The Christian Baptist.</q>
</p>

<p>
He and his father, Thomas Campbell, renounced the
Presbyterian system, and were immersed, in the year 1812.
They, and the congregations which they had formed, united
with the Redstone Baptist association, protesting against
all human creeds as bonds of union, and professing subjection
to the Bible alone. This union took place in the year
1813. But, in pressing upon the attention of that society
and the public the all-sufficiency of the <emph>sacred</emph> Scriptures
for every thing necessary to the perfection of Christian character,&mdash;whether
in the private or social relations of life, in
the church, or in the world,&mdash;they began to be opposed by a
strong creed-party in that association. After some ten years
debating and contending for the Bible alone, and the apostles'
doctrine, Alexander Campbell, and the church to which
he belonged, united with the Mahoning association, in the
Western Reserve of Ohio; that association being more favorable
to his views of reform.
</p>

<p>
In his debates on the subject and action of baptism with
Mr. Walker, a seceding minister, in the year 1820, and with
Mr. M'Calla, a Presbyterian minister of Kentucky, in the
year 1823, his views of reformation began to be developed,
and were very generally received by the Baptist society, as
far as these works were read.
</p>

<p>
But in his <q>Christian Baptist,</q> which began July 4, 1823
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
his views of the need of reformation were more fully exposed,
and, as these gained ground by the pleading of various ministers
of the Baptist denomination, a party in opposition
began to exert itself, and to oppose the spread of what they
were pleased to call heterodoxy. But not till after great numbers
began to act upon these principles, was there any attempt
towards separation. After the Mahoning association appointed
Mr. Walter Scott an evangelist, in the year 1827, and
when great numbers began to be immersed into Christ, under
his labors, and new churches began to be erected by him
and other laborers in the field, did the Baptist associations
begin to declare non-fellowship with the brethren of the
reformation. Thus by constraint, not of choice, they were
obliged to form societies out of those communities that split,
upon the ground of adherence to the apostles' doctrine.
The distinguishing characteristics of their views and practices
are the following:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
They regard all the sects and parties of the Christian
world as having, in greater or less degrees, departed from
the simplicity of faith and manners of the first Christians,
and as forming what the apostle Paul calls <q>the apostasy.</q>
This defection they attribute to the great varieties of speculation
and metaphysical dogmatism of the countless creeds,
formularies, liturgies, and books of discipline, adopted and
inculcated as bonds of union and platforms of communion
in all the parties which have sprung from the Lutheran
reformation. The effect of these synodical covenants, conventional
articles of belief, and rules of ecclesiastical polity,
has been the introduction of a new nomenclature,&mdash;a human
vocabulary of religious words, phrases, and technicalities,
which has displaced the style of the living oracles, and
affixed to the sacred diction ideas wholly unknown to the
apostles of Christ.
</p>

<p>
To remedy and obviate these aberrations, they propose to
ascertain from the holy Scriptures, according to the commonly-received
and well-established rules of interpretation,
the ideas attached to the leading terms and sentences found
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
in the holy Scriptures, and then to use the words of the
Holy Spirit in the apostolic acceptation of them.
</p>

<p>
By thus expressing the ideas communicated by the Holy
Spirit, in the terms and phrases learned from the apostles,
and by avoiding the artificial and technical language of
scholastic theology, they propose to restore a pure speech to
the household of faith; and, by accustoming the family of
God to use the language and dialect of the heavenly Father,
they expect to promote the sanctification of one another
through the truth, and to terminate those discords and debates
which have always originated from the words which
man's wisdom teaches, and from a reverential regard and
esteem for the style of the great masters of polemic divinity;
believing that speaking the same things in the same style, is
the only certain way to thinking the same things.
</p>

<p>
They make a very marked difference between faith and
opinion; between the testimony of God and the reasonings
of men; the words of the Spirit and human inferences.
Faith in the testimony of God, and obedience to the commandments
of Jesus, are their bond of union, and not an
agreement in any abstract views or opinions upon what is
written or spoken by divine authority. Hence all the speculations,
questions, debates of words, and abstract reasonings,
found in human creeds, have no place in their religious
fellowship. Regarding Calvinism and Arminianism, Trinitarianism
and Unitarianism, and all the opposing theories
of religious sectaries, as <emph>extremes</emph> begotten by each other,
they cautiously avoid them, as equidistant from the simplicity
and practical tendency of the promises and precepts, of the
doctrine and facts, of the exhortations and precedents, of the
Christian institution.
</p>

<p>
They look for unity of spirit and the bonds of peace in
the practical acknowledgment of one faith, one Lord, one
immersion, one hope, one body, one Spirit, one God and
Father of all; not in unity of opinions, nor in unity of forms,
ceremonies, or modes of worship.
</p>

<p>
The holy Scriptures of both Testaments they regard as
<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>
containing revelations from God, and as all necessary to
make the man of God perfect, and accomplished for every
good word and work; the New Testament, or the living
oracles of Jesus Christ, they understand as containing the
Christian religion; the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John, they view as illustrating and proving the great
proposition on which our religion rests, viz., <emph>that Jesus of
Nazareth is the Messiah, the only-begotten and well-beloved
Son of God, and the only Savior of the world</emph>; the Acts of
the Apostles as a divinely-authorized narrative of the beginning
and progress of the reign or kingdom of Jesus Christ,
recording the full development of <emph>the gospel</emph> by the Holy
Spirit sent down from heaven, and the procedure of the
apostles in setting up the church of Christ on earth; the
Epistles as carrying out and applying the doctrine of the
apostles to the practice of individuals and congregations, and
as developing the tendencies of the gospel in the behavior of
its professors; and all as forming a complete standard of
Christian faith and morals, adapted to the interval between
the ascension of Christ and his return with the kingdom
which he has received from God; the Apocalypse, or Revelation
of Jesus Christ to John, in Patmos, as a figurative and
prospective view of all the fortunes of Christianity, from its
date to the return of the Savior.
</p>

<p>
Every one who sincerely believes the testimony which God
gave of Jesus of Nazareth, saying, <q><hi rend='italic'>This is my Son, the
beloved, in whom I delight</hi>,</q> or, in other words, believes
what the evangelists and apostles have testified concerning
him, from his conception to his coronation in heaven as
Lord of all, and who is willing to obey him in every thing,
they regard as a proper subject of immersion, and no one
else. They consider immersion into the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, after a public, sincere, and intelligent
confession of the faith in Jesus, as necessary to admission to
the privileges of the kingdom of the Messiah, and as a solemn
pledge, on the part of Heaven, of the actual remission
of all past sins, and of adoption into the family of God.
</p>

<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>

<p>
The Holy Spirit is promised only to those who believe and
obey the Savior. No one is taught to expect the reception
of that heavenly Monitor and Comforter, as a resident in his
heart, till he obeys the gospel.
</p>

<p>
Thus, while they proclaim faith and repentance, or faith
and a change of heart, as preparatory to immersion, remission,
and the Holy Spirit, they say to all penitents, or all those who
believe and repent of their sins, as Peter said to the first audience
addressed after the Holy Spirit was bestowed, after the
glorification of Jesus, <q>Be immersed, every one of you, in
the name of the Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins, and
you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</q> They teach
sinners that God commands <emph>all men</emph>, every where, to reform,
or to turn to God; that the Holy Spirit strives with them, so
to do, by the apostles and prophets; that God beseeches them
to be reconciled, through Jesus Christ; and that it is the
duty of all men to believe the gospel, and turn to God.
</p>

<p>
The immersed believers are congregated into societies, according
to their propinquity to each other, and taught to meet
every first day of the week, in honor and commemoration of
the resurrection of Jesus, and to break the loaf, which commemorates
the death of the Son of God, to read and hear the
living oracles, to teach and admonish one another, to unite in
all prayer and praise, to contribute to the necessities of saints,
and to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Every congregation chooses its own overseers and deacons,
who preside over and administer the affairs of the congregations;
and every church, either from itself, or in coöperation
with others, sends out, as opportunity offers, one or more
evangelists, or proclaimers of the word, to preach the word,
and to immerse those who believe, to gather congregations,
and to extend the knowledge of salvation where it is necessary,
as far as their means allow. But every church regards
these evangelists as its servants; and, therefore, they have no
control over any congregation, each congregation being subject
to its own choice of presidents or elders, whom they have
appointed. Perseverance in all the work of faith, labor of
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
love, and patience of hope, is inculcated, by all the disciples,
as essential to admission into the heavenly kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Such are the prominent outlines of the faith and practices
of those who wish to be known as the Disciples of Christ;
but no society among them would agree to make the preceding
items either a confession of faith or a standard of
practice, but, for the information of those who wish an acquaintance
with them, are willing to give, at any time, a
reason for their faith, hope, and practice.

<head>Friends, or Quakers.</head>

<p>
This class of Christians arose in England about the middle
of the 17th century. They were at first called <hi rend='italic'>Seekers</hi>, from
their seeking the truth; and afterwards <hi rend='italic'>Quakers</hi>, for directing
their enemies to tremble at the word of the Lord. They
prefer the more endearing appellation of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Friends</hi>, which has
been transmitted to them by their predecessors.
</p>

<p>
George Fox was the first who publicly advocated their
principles in England, and the celebrated William Penn in
America.
</p>

<p>
The following is a <hi rend='smallcaps'>summary</hi> of the doctrines and discipline
of the society of Friends, published in London in 1800, and
sanctioned by the orthodox society of Friends in this country.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Doctrine.</hi>&mdash;<q rend='pre'>We agree, with other professors
of the Christian name, in the belief of one eternal God, the Creator
and Preserver of the universe, and in Jesus Christ, his
Son, the Messiah, and Mediator of the new covenant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When we speak of the gracious display of the love of
God to mankind, in the miraculous conception, birth, life,
miracles, death, resurrection, and ascension, of our Savior,
we prefer the use of such terms as we find in Scripture; and,
contented with that knowledge which Divine Wisdom hath
seen meet to reveal, we attempt not to explain those mysteries
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
which remain under the veil; nevertheless, we acknowledge
and assert the divinity of Christ, who is the wisdom
and power of God unto salvation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>To Christ, alone, we give the title of the Word of God,
and not to the Scriptures; although we highly esteem these
sacred writings, in subordination to the Spirit, from which
they were given forth; and we hold, with the apostle Paul,
that they are able to make wise unto salvation, through faith
which is in Christ Jesus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We reverence those most excellent precepts which are
recorded, in Scripture, to have been delivered by our great
Lord; and we firmly believe that they are practicable, and
binding on every Christian, and that, in the life to come, every
man will be rewarded according to his works. And, further,
it is our belief that, in order to enable mankind to put in
practice these sacred precepts, many of which are contradictory
to the unregenerate will of man, every man, coming
into the world, is endued with a measure of the light, grace,
or good spirit, of Christ, by which, as it is attended to, he is
enabled to distinguish good from evil, and to correct the disorderly
passions and corrupt propensities of his nature,
which mere reason is altogether insufficient to overcome.
For all that belongs to man is fallible, and within the reach
of temptation; but this divine grace, which comes by Him
who hath overcome the world, is, to those who humbly and
sincerely seek it, an all-sufficient and present help in time of
need. By this, the snares of the enemy are detected, his
allurements avoided, and deliverance is experienced, through
faith in its effectual operation; whereby the soul is translated
out of the kingdom of darkness, and from under the power
of Satan, into the marvellous light and kingdom of the Son
of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Being thus persuaded that man, without the Spirit of Christ
inwardly revealed, can do nothing to the glory of God, or to
effect his own salvation, we think this influence especially
necessary to the performance of the highest act of which the
human mind is capable,&mdash;even the worship of the Father of
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
lights and of spirits, in spirit and in truth; therefore we consider
as obstruction to pure worship, all forms which divert
the attention of the mind from the secret influence of this
unction from the Holy One. Yet, although true worship is
not confined to time and place, we think it incumbent on
Christians to meet often together, in testimony of their dependence
on the heavenly Father, and for a renewal of their
spiritual strength: nevertheless, in the performance of worship,
we dare not depend, for our acceptance with him, on a
formal repetition of the words and experiences of others; but
we believe it to be our duty to lay aside the activity of the
imagination, and to wait in silence, to have a true sight of
our condition bestowed upon us; believing even a single
sight, arising from such a sense of our infirmities, and of the
need we have of divine help, to be more acceptable to God
than any performances, however specious, which originate in
the will of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>From what has been said respecting worship, it follows
that the ministry we approve must have its origin from the
same source; for that which is needful for man's own direction,
and for his acceptance with God, must be eminently so
to enable him to be helpful to others. Accordingly, we believe
that the renewed assistance of the light and power of
Christ is indispensably necessary for all true ministry, and
that this holy influence is not at our command, or to be procured
by study, but is the free gift of God to chosen and devoted
servants. Hence arises our testimony against preaching
for hire, in contradiction to Christ's positive command,
<q>Freely ye have received, freely give;</q> and hence our conscientious
refusal to support such ministry by tithes or other
means.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As we dare not encourage any ministry but that which
we believe to spring from the influence of the Holy Spirit, so
neither dare we attempt to restrain this influence to persons
of any condition in life, or to the male sex alone; but, as
male and female are one in Christ, we allow such of the female
sex as we believe to be endued with a right qualification
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
for the ministry, to exercise their gifts for the general
edification of the church; and this liberty we esteem a peculiar
mark of the gospel dispensation, as foretold by the
prophet Joel, and noticed by the apostle Peter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are two ceremonies in use among most professors
of the Christian name&mdash;water baptism, and what is termed
the Lord's supper. The first of these is generally esteemed
the essential means of initiation into the church of Christ,
and the latter of maintaining communion with him. But, as
we have been convinced that nothing short of his redeeming
power, inwardly revealed, can set the soul free from the
thraldom of sin, by this power alone we believe salvation to
be effected. We hold that, as there is one Lord, and one
faith, so his baptism is one, in nature and operation; that
nothing short of it can make us living members of his mystical
body; and that the baptism with water, administered by
his forerunner John, belonged, as the latter confessed, to an
inferior and decreasing dispensation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With respect to the other rite, we believe that communion
between Christ and his church is not maintained by
that, nor any other external performance, but only by a real
participation of his divine nature, through faith; that this is
the supper alluded to in Revelation, <q>Behold, I stand at the
door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the
door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
with me;</q> and that, where the substance is attained, it is unnecessary
to attend to the shadow, which doth not confer
grace, and concerning which, opinions so different, and animosities
so violent, have arisen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, as we thus believe that the grace of God, which
comes by Jesus Christ, is alone sufficient for salvation, we
can neither admit that it is conferred on a few only, whilst
others are left without it, nor, thus asserting its universality,
can we limit its operation to a partial cleansing of the soul
from sin, even in this life. We entertain worthier notions,
both of the power and goodness of our heavenly Father, and
believe that he doth vouchsafe to assist the obedient to experience
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
a total surrender of the natural will to the guidance
of his pure, unerring Spirit, through whose renewed assistance
they are enabled to bring forth fruits unto holiness,
and to stand perfect in their present rank.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are not many of our tenets more generally known
than our testimony against oaths, and against war. With
respect to the former of these, we abide literally by Christ's
positive injunction, delivered in his Sermon on the Mount,
<q>Swear not at all.</q> From the same sacred collection of the
most excellent precepts of moral and religious duty, from the
example of our Lord himself, and from the correspondent
convictions of his Spirit in our hearts, we are confirmed in
the belief that wars and fightings are, in their origin and
effects, utterly repugnant to the gospel, which still breathes
peace and good-will to men. We also are clearly of the
judgment, that, if the benevolence of the gospel were generally
prevalent in the minds of men, it would effectually
prevent them from oppressing, much more enslaving, their
brethren, (of whatever color or complexion,) for whom, as
for themselves, Christ died; and would even influence their
conduct in their treatment of the brute creation, which
would no longer groan, the victims of their avarice, or of
their false ideas of pleasure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Some of our tenets have, in former times, as hath been
shown, subjected our friends to much suffering from government,
though to the salutary purposes of government our
principles are a security. They inculcate submission to the
laws in all cases wherein conscience is not violated. But
we hold that, as Christ's kingdom is not of this world, it is
not the business of the civil magistrate to interfere in matters
of religion, but to maintain the external peace and good
order of the community. We, therefore, think persecution,
even in the smallest degree, unwarrantable. We are careful
in requiring our members not to be concerned in illicit trade,
nor in any manner to defraud the revenue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is well known that the society, from its first appearance,
has disused those names of the months and days, which
<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>
having been given in honor of the heroes or false gods of the
heathen, originated in their flattery or superstition; and the
custom of speaking to a single person in the plural number,
as having arisen also from motives of adulation. Compliments,
superfluity of apparel, and furniture, outward shows
of rejoicing and mourning, and the observation of days and
times, we esteem to be incompatible with the simplicity and
sincerity of a Christian life; and public diversions, gaming,
and other vain amusements of the world, we cannot but condemn.
They are a waste of that time which is given us for
nobler purposes, and divert the attention of the mind from
the sober duties of life, and from the reproofs of instruction,
by which we are guided to an everlasting inheritance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>To conclude: Although we have exhibited the several
tenets which distinguish our religious society, as objects of
our belief, yet we are sensible that a true and living faith is
not produced in the mind of man by his own effort, but is
the free gift of God in Christ Jesus, nourished and increased
by the progressive operation of his Spirit in our hearts, and
our proportionate obedience. Therefore, although, for the
preservation of the testimonies given us to bear, and for the
peace and good order of the society, we deem it necessary
that those who are admitted into membership with us should
be previously convinced of those doctrines which we esteem
essential, yet we require no formal subscription to any
articles, either as a condition of membership, or a qualification
for the service of the church. We prefer the judging
of men by their fruits, and depending on the aid of Him,
who, by his prophet, hath promised to be <q>a spirit of judgment
to him that sitteth in judgment.</q> Without this there
is a danger of receiving numbers into outward communion,
without any addition to that spiritual sheepfold, whereof our
blessed Lord declared himself to be both the door and the shepherd;
that is, such as know his voice, and follow him in the
paths of obedience.</q> (See Heb. 12:24. 1 Cor. 1:24. John
1:1. 2 Pet. 1:21. 2 Tim. 3:15. Matt. 16:27. John
1:9-16, 33. 1 John 2:20, 27. Heb. 10:25. Rom 8:26.
<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>

</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Discipline.</hi>&mdash;The purposes which our
discipline hath chiefly in view, are, the relief of the poor; the maintenance
of good order; the support of the testimonies which we believe
it is our duty to bear to the world; and the help and
recovery of such as are overtaken in faults.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In the practice of discipline, we think it indispensable that
the order recommended by Christ himself be invariably observed.
<q>If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall
hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother; but if he will not
hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the
mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established;
and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
church.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>To effect the salutary purposes of discipline, meetings
were appointed, at an early period of the society, which,
from the times of their being held, were called <hi rend='italic'>quarterly
meetings</hi>. It was afterward found expedient to divide the
districts of those meetings, and to meet more frequently;
from whence arose <hi rend='italic'>monthly meetings</hi>, subordinate to those
held quarterly. At length, in 1669, a <hi rend='italic'>yearly meeting</hi> was
established, to superintend, assist, and provide rules for the
whole; previously to which, <hi rend='italic'>general meetings</hi> had been occasionally
held.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A monthly meeting is usually composed of several particular
congregations, situated within a convenient distance
from each other. Its business is to provide for the subsistence
of the poor, and for the education of their offspring; to
judge of the sincerity and fitness of persons appearing to be
convinced of the religious principles of the society, and desiring
to be admitted into membership; to excite due attention
to the discharge of religious and moral duty; and to
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
deal with disorderly members. Monthly meetings also grant
to such of their members as remove into other monthly meetings,
certificates of their membership and conduct, without
which they cannot gain membership in such meetings.
Each monthly meeting is required to appoint certain persons,
under the name of <hi rend='italic'>overseers</hi>, who are to take care that the
rules of our discipline be put in practice, and, when any case
of complaint, or disorderly conduct, comes to their knowledge,
to see that private admonition, agreeably to the gospel
rule before mentioned, be given, previously to its being laid
before the monthly meeting.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When a case is introduced, it is usual for a small committee
to be appointed to visit the offender, to endeavor to
convince him of his error, and to induce him to forsake and
condemn it. If they succeed, the person is by minute declared
to have made satisfaction for the offence; if not, he is
disowned as a member of the society.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In disputes between individuals, it has long been the decided
judgment of the society, that its members should not
sue each other at law. It therefore enjoins all to end their
differences by speedy and impartial arbitration, agreeably to
rules laid down. If any refuse to adopt this mode, or, having
adopted it, to submit to the award, it is the direction of
the yearly meeting that such be disowned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>To monthly meetings, also, belongs the allowing of marriages;
for our society hath always scrupled to acknowledge
the exclusive authority of the priests in the solemnization of
marriage. Those who intend to marry appear together, and
propose their intention to the monthly meeting, and, if not
attended by their parents and guardians, produce a written
certificate of their consent, signed in the presence of witnesses.
The meeting then appoints a committee to inquire
whether they be clear of other engagements respecting marriage;
and if, at a subsequent meeting, to which the parties
also come and declare the continuance of their intention, no
objections be reported, they have the meeting's consent to
solemnize their intended marriage. This is done in a public
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
meeting for worship, toward the close whereof the parties
stand up, and solemnly take each other for husband and wife.
A certificate of the proceedings is then publicly read, and
signed by the parties, and afterward by the relations and
others as witnesses. Of such marriage the monthly meeting
keeps a record, as also of the births and burials of its members.
A certificate of the date, of the name of the infant,
and of its parents, signed by those present at the birth, is the
subject of one of these last-mentioned records, and an order
for the interment, countersigned by the grave-maker, of
the other. The naming of children is without ceremony.
Burials are also conducted in a simple manner. The body,
followed by the relations and friends, is sometimes, previously
to interment, carried to a meeting; and at the grave a
pause is generally made; on both which occasions it frequently
falls out, that one or more friends present have somewhat
to express for the edification of those who attend; but
no religious rite is considered as an essential part of burial.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Several monthly meetings compose a quarterly meeting.
At the quarterly meeting are produced written answers from
the monthly meetings, to certain queries respecting the conduct
of their members, and the meetings' care over them.
The accounts thus received are digested into one, which is
sent also in the form of answers to queries, by representatives,
to the yearly meeting. Appeals from the judgment of
monthly meetings are brought to the quarterly meetings,
whose business also it is to assist in any difficult case, or
where remissness appears in the care of the monthly meetings
over the individuals who compose them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The yearly meeting has the general superintendence of
the society in the country in which it is established; and
therefore, as the accounts which it receives discover the state
of inferior meetings, as particular exigencies require, or as
the meeting is impressed with a sense of duty, it gives forth
its advice, makes such regulations as appear to be requisite,
or excites to the observance of those already made, and
sometimes appoints committees to visit those quarterly meetings
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
which appear to be in need of immediate advice.
Appeals from the judgment of quarterly meetings are here
finally determined; and a brotherly correspondence, by
epistles, is maintained with other yearly meetings.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In this place it is proper to add that, as we believe women
may be rightly called to the work of the ministry, we also
think that to them belongs a share in the support of our
Christian discipline, and that some parts of it, wherein their
own sex is concerned, devolve on them with peculiar propriety;
accordingly, they have monthly, quarterly, and yearly
meetings of their own sex, held at the same time and in the
same place with those of the men, but separately, and without
the power of making rules; and it may be remarked that,
during the persecutions, which, in the last century, occasioned
the imprisonment of so many of the men, the care of the
poor often fell on the women, and was by them satisfactorily
administered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In order that those who are in the situation of ministers
may have the tender sympathy and counsel of those of either
sex, who, by their experience in the work of religion, are
qualified for that service, the monthly meetings are advised
to select such, under the denomination of <hi rend='italic'>elders</hi>. These,
and ministers approved by their monthly meetings, have
meetings peculiar to themselves, called <hi rend='italic'>meetings of ministers
and elders</hi>, in which they have an opportunity of exciting
each other to a discharge of their several duties, and of extending
advice to those who may appear to be weak, without
any needless exposure. Such meetings are generally held in
the compass of each monthly, quarterly, and yearly meeting.
They are conducted by rules prescribed by the yearly
meeting, and have no authority to make any alteration or
addition to them. The members of them unite with their
brethren in the meetings for discipline, and are equally
accountable to the latter for their conduct.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus have we given a view of the foundation and establishment
of our discipline; by which it will be seen that it
is not, as hath been frequently insinuated, merely the work
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
of modern times, but was the early care and concern of our
pious predecessors. We cannot better close this short sketch
of it, than by observing that, if the exercise of discipline should
in some instances appear to press hard upon those, who, neglecting
the monitions of divine counsel in their hearts, are
also unwilling to be accountable to their brethren, yet, if
that great, leading, and indispensable rule, enjoined by our
Lord, be observed by those who undertake to be active in it,&mdash;<q>Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do
ye even so to them,</q>&mdash;it will prevent the censure of the
church from falling on any thing but that which really
obstructs the progress of truth. Discipline will then promote,
in an eminent degree, that love of our neighbor which is the
mark of discipleship, and without which a profession of love
to God, and to his cause, is a vain pretence. <q>He,</q> said the
beloved disciple, <q>that loveth not his brother, whom he hath
seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen? And this
commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God,
love his brother also.</q></q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
The Friends are divided in sentiment; there are, in fact,
two sects, denominated <hi rend='italic'>Orthodox</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Hicksites</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Some opinion of Elias Hicks's sentiments, in regard to the
Trinity, may be formed by an extract from one of his publications,
(Sermons, vol. iv. pp. 288, 289.)
</p>

<p>
<q>He that laid down his life, and suffered his body to be
crucified by the Jews, without the gates of Jerusalem, is
Christ, the only Son of the most high God. But that the
<emph>outward person which suffered</emph> was properly the Son of God,
we utterly deny. Flesh and blood cannot enter into heaven.
By the analogy of reason, spirit cannot beget a material body,
because the thing begotten must be of the same nature with
its father. Spirit cannot beget any thing but spirit: it cannot
beget flesh and blood. <q><hi rend='italic'>A body hast thou prepared me</hi>,</q>
said the Son: <emph>then the Son was not the body</emph>, though the
body was the Son's.</q>

<p>
The editor gives an account of the religious tenets, &amp;c.,
of this society, in the precise words of his worthy friends and
correspondents at Enfield, N. H.:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Respected Friend,</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Having received your circular, requesting information
concerning our society, we freely notice it, and
are most willing to give you any information respecting us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It appears your request extends sufficiently far to embrace
an exposition of our moral and religious tenets, our faith,
principles, and manner of life, our secular concerns, &amp;c.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We have seen several historical sketches of our society
by different writers; but it is very rare to find one free from
misrepresentations of some kind, which must be owing either
to ignorance or prejudice. Therefore, in our communications,
we may be somewhat particular on some points; in any
of which, if there be any thing found agreeable to your desires,
you are welcome to it; and, as it is presumed your
publication is intended for information, among other truths,
we hope to see something relative to us, different from most
of the descriptions of former writers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In obtaining information of one society, you get a general
understanding of all; for we are of one heart and one
mind. Our faith is one, our practice is one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We are acknowledged and distinguished as a peculiar
people, singular from all others; which peculiarity arises
wholly from these two principles&mdash;our faith and manner of
life, which comprise our motives in separating from the
course and practice of the world, the manner in which our
property is held, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is a fact acknowledged by all professed Christians, that
there are two creations, an old and a new; or, which is the
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
same thing, two kingdoms, the kingdom of this world, and
the kingdom of Christ. It is also a truth as frankly granted,
that these two creations, or kingdoms, are headed, the one by
the first Adam, denominated the <hi rend='italic'>old man</hi>, and the other by
the second Adam, Christ Jesus, denominated the <hi rend='italic'>new man</hi>&mdash;two
different personages, possessing very different spirits, and
executing very different works. As positive as the preceding
declarations are, that there exist two distinct creations, and
which are headed by two distinct characters, so positive are
the following:&mdash;that the subjects of each kingdom bear a
strong resemblance to their respective king, and plainly represent
the particular kingdom they inhabit; for, <q>As we have
borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image
of the heavenly.</q> (1 Cor. 15:49.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Also that no person can have demands upon, and privileges
in, these two men and creations at one and the same
time. We must either hold to the old, and have nothing to
do with the new, or we must come out and forsake the old,
and come into the new. We must either put off the old man,
Adam, and his works, which are well known to be multiplying
and supporting of an earthly kingdom, which is the kingdom
of this world, or we must put on the new man, Christ
Jesus, and his works, which are well known to be a life without
spot, chaste, virgin, and unstained by indulgences in any
of those things which a beloved worthy said constitutes the
world. (1 John 2:15, 16.) To these principles of faith we
are strict, and may be called rigid, adherents; equally tenacious
in the practical part of the new man, and in the same
degree pointed against the old.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The second part of this subject of singularity in us consists
in the manner in which we hold our property, which,
perhaps, is well known to be in common, after the order of
the primitive church in the days of the apostles, in which
state we have lived rising forty years, <q>of one heart and one
soul;</q> not any of us saying that <q>aught of the things which
he possessed was his own,</q> (Acts 4:32;) <q>buying as though
we possessed not,</q> (1 Cor. 7:30;) and <q>having nothing, and
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
yet possessing all things.</q> (2 Cor. 6:10.) In consequence
thereof, we are retired from the world, as not of that kingdom;
<q>My kingdom is not of this world,</q> &amp;c., (John 18:36;)
by which we enjoy a closer communion with our God, and
by which we follow the instruction of the Spirit, which saith,
<q>Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate,</q> &amp;c.
(2 Cor. 6:17.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Our society contains three distinct families, comprising
233 souls; 103 males, and 130 females. The number of
persons over 70 is 18; between 60 and 70, 21; between 21
and 60, 125; under 21, 63. The oldest person is 88.
Deaths since the gathering of the society, in 1792, 85.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Our village is situated in the N. W. corner of the town,
on the western shore of <hi rend='italic'>Mascomy Pond</hi>, a pleasant sheet of
water, of nearly five miles in length, and half a mile average
width. Our village and home are pleasant to us, and are said
to be so by travellers. It is about ten miles S. E. from
Dartmouth College, forty N. W. from Concord, and one
hundred from Boston.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In all the families there are nearly thirty buildings, unadorned,
except with neatness, simplicity, and convenience,
besides many out-buildings. Among the buildings are one
house of public worship, one convenient school-house, three
dwelling-houses, one for each family, sufficiently large to accommodate
us as places for cooking, eating, sleeping, and retirement
from labor, and shops for the different branches of
work. Our privilege for mills is very small; consequently
our machinery cannot be extensive. Yet the little water that
is running in small brooks, which can be conveniently collected
into artificial ponds, is improved, by their emptying
from one to another, and by the interspersion of mills upon
their discharging streams. We have three saw-mills, two
grist-mills, and some other machinery.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As strangers, who many times wish to call, are frequently
much straitened and embarrassed by not knowing where to
call, or what to say, we should be pleased to have it particularly
noticed, that we have one building designated from the
<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>
rest by the sign, <q>Trustees' Office,</q> over the door, where
strangers are received, where our commercial business is
transacted, and where civil people wishing for information
may freely obtain it, or be directed where it can be obtained.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In our occupation we are agriculturists and mechanics.
The products of the garden may be said to be as important
as any; which are principally seeds, herbs, &amp;c., from which
this section of the country is chiefly supplied. Our manufactures
are wooden ware, such as tubs, pails, half-bushel
and other measures, boxes, &amp;c.; also, whips, corn-brooms,
leather, and various other articles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We keep from 1200 to 1500 sheep, mostly Saxon and
Merino, which afford wool for our own wear, and is likewise
a source of small trade with us. We keep about eighty
cows, which supply us with milk for a dairy, for our own
consumption only.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The education of our youth and children has been a subject
of much conversation among many people. It has been
reported, that the children which we frequently take in and
bring up with us, are kept in ignorance, having no opportunity
of improving their minds by a literary education. But
the weight of this censure is gradually growing less, by the
contrary proof to the hundreds of visitors who flock into our
school, and who are not at all sparing of their high encomiums
upon it. It is conducted partially on the Lancasterian
system, and is said to surpass any of the common schools
about us. Our school-room is furnished with books and apparatus
of a superior kind, which, we presume, is not equalled
by any school in the country, save the one among our people
at Canterbury, which, perhaps, is not in any respect inferior.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In this society are two physicians. Each family has its
respective elders or ministers; among these and other individuals
of the society, are public speakers, whom you would
denominate the clergy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, from what we have here written, that we have
taken up many subjects, and several of them explicitly treated
upon, although short; from which, together with the pamphlet
<pb n='079'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>
accompanying this letter, we conclude you may be able
to get considerable of an understanding, and which you are
at liberty to call at your pleasure. But it is sincerely to be
hoped, if you publish any thing concerning us, you will be
careful to preserve the true ideas of our communications.</q>

<p>
From the pamphlet above mentioned we make the following
extracts:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<q rend='pre'>Faith And Principles Of The Society.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. A life of <emph>innocence</emph> and <emph>purity</emph>, according to
the example of Jesus Christ and his first true followers; implying
entire abstinence from all sensual and carnal gratifications.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Love.</hi>&mdash;<q>By this shall all men know that
ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Love is the fulfilling
of the law.</q> This is our bond of union.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Peace.</hi>&mdash;<q>Follow peace with all men,</q>
is a divine precept; hence our abstinence from war and bloodshed, from
all acts of violence towards our fellow-men, from all the
party contentions and politics of the world, and from all the
pursuits of pride and worldly ambition. <q>My kingdom (said
Christ) is not of this world.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Justice.</hi>&mdash;<q>Render
to every man his due. Owe no
man any thing, but to love one another.</q> We are to be just
and honest in all our dealings with mankind, to discharge all
just dues, duties, and equitable claims, as seasonably and
effectually as possible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Holiness.</hi>&mdash;<q>Without
which no man shall see the
Lord.</q> Which signifies to be <emph>consecrated</emph>, or set apart from
a common to a sacred use. Hence arise all our doctrines
and practical rules of dedicating our persons, services, and
property, to social and sacred uses, having adopted the example
of the first gospel church, in establishing and supporting
one <emph>consecrated</emph> and <emph>united</emph> interest by the voluntary choice
of every member, as a sacred privilege, and not by any undue
constraint or persuasion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Goodness.</hi>&mdash;Do
good to all men, as far as opportunity
<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>
and ability may serve, by administering acts of charity
and kindness, and promoting light and truth among mankind.
<q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even
so to them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Truth.</hi>&mdash;This principle is opposed to
falsehood, lying, deceit, and hypocrisy, and implies fidelity, reality,
good, earnest sincerity, and punctuality in keeping vows and
promises. These principles are the genuine basis of our
institution, planted by its first founders, exhibited in all our
public writings, justified by Scripture and fair reason, and
practically commended as a system of morality and religion,
adapted to the best interest and happiness of man, both here
and hereafter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Manner Of Admitting Members.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. All persons who unite with this society, in any degree,
must do it freely and voluntarily, according to their
own faith and unbiased judgment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. In the testimony of the society, both public and private,
no flattery nor any undue influence is used, but the
most plain and explicit statements of its faith and principles
are laid before the inquirer, so that the whole ground may
be comprehended, as far as possible, by every candidate for
admission.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. No considerations of property are ever made use of,
by this society, to induce any person to join it, nor to prevent
any one from leaving it; because it is our faith, that no act
of devotion, or service, that does not flow from the free and
voluntary emotions of the heart, can be acceptable to God, as
an act of true religion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. No believing husband, or wife, is allowed, by the
principles of this society, to separate from an unbelieving
partner, except by mutual agreement, unless the conduct of
the unbeliever be such as to warrant a separation by the laws
of God and man. Nor can any husband, or wife, who has
otherwise abandoned his or her partner, be received into
communion with the society.</q>
</p>

<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. Any person becoming a member, must rectify all his
wrongs, and, as fast and as far as it is in his power, discharge
all just and legal claims, whether of creditors or filial heirs.
Nor can any person, not conforming to this rule, long remain
in union with the society. But the society is not responsible
for the debts of any individual, except by agreement
because such responsibility would involve a principle ruinous
to the institution.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. No difference is to be made in the distribution of
parental estate among the heirs, whether they belong to the
society or not; but an equal partition must be made, as far
as may be practicable, and consistent with reason and
justice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. If an unbelieving wife separate from a believing husband,
by agreement, the husband must give her a just and
reasonable share of the property; and if they have children
who have arrived to years of understanding sufficient to judge
for themselves, and who choose to go with their mother, they
are not to be disinherited on that account. Though the
character of this institution has been much censured on this
ground, yet we boldly assert that the rule above stated has
never, to our knowledge, been violated by this society.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>8. Industry, temperance, and frugality, are prominent
features of this institution. No member who is able to labor,
can be permitted to live idly upon the labors of others. All
are required to be employed in some manual occupation,
according to their several abilities, when not engaged in
other necessary duties.</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The rules of government in the society are adapted to
the different orders of which it is composed. In all (as far
as respects adults) it is spiritual; its powers and authorities
growing out of the <emph>mutual faith, love, and confidence</emph>, of all
the members, and harmoniously concurring in the general
form and manner of government established by the first
founders of the society.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The leading authority of the society is vested in a
<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>
ministry, generally consisting of four persons, including both
sexes. These, together with the elders and trustees, constitute
the general government of the society in all its
branches, and, being supported by the general union and
approbation of the members, are invested with power to
appoint their successors and other subordinate officers, as
occasion may require; to counsel, advise, and direct, in all
matters, whether of a spiritual or temporal nature; to superintend
the concerns of the several families, and establish all
needful orders, rules, and regulations, for the direction and
protection of the several branches of the society; but no rule
can be made, nor any member assume a lead, contrary to the
original faith and known principles of the society. And
nothing which respects the government, order, and general
arrangement, of the society is considered as fully established
until it has received the general approbation of the society,
or of that branch thereof which it more immediately concerns.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This community is divided into several different branches,
commonly called <hi rend='italic'>families</hi>. This division is generally made
for the sake of convenience, and is often rendered necessary
on account of local situation and occurrent circumstances;
but the proper division and arrangement of the community,
without respect to local situation, are into three classes, or
progressive degrees of order.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Those children taken into the society are treated with
care and tenderness, receive a good school education, and,
according to their genius, are trained to industry and virtuous
habits, restrained from vice, and, at a suitable age, led
into the knowledge of the sacred Scriptures, and practically
taught the divine precepts contained in them, particularly
those of Jesus Christ and the apostles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>During a period of more than forty years, since the
permanent establishment of this society at New Lebanon
and Watervliet, there never has been a legal claim entered
by any person for the recovery of property brought into the
society but all claims of that nature, if any have existed,
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
have been amicably settled, to the satisfaction of the parties
concerned. Complaints and legal prosecutions have not,
hitherto, come from persons who brought property into the
institution, but from those who came destitute of property,
and who, generally speaking, have been no benefit to the
society in any way, but, on the contrary, after having
enjoyed its hospitality, and brought no small share of trouble
upon the people, have had the assurance to lay claim to
wages which they never earned, or property to which they
never had any just or legal claim.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No person can be received into this order until he shall
have settled all just and legal claims, both of creditors and
filial heirs; so that whatever property he may possess, may
be justly and truly his own. Minors cannot be admitted as
covenant members of this order; yet they may be received
under its immediate care and protection. And when they
shall have arrived at lawful age, if they should choose to continue
in the society, and sign the covenant of the order, and
support its principles, they are then admitted to all the
privileges of members. The members of this order are all
equally entitled to the benefits and privileges thereof, without
any difference made on account of what any one may have
contributed to the interest of the society. All are equally
entitled to their support and maintenance, and to every
necessary comfort, whether in health, sickness, or old age, so
long as they continue to maintain the principles, and conform
to the orders, rules, and regulations, of the institution.
They, therefore, give their property and services for the
most valuable of all temporal considerations&mdash;an ample security,
during life, for every needful support, if they continue
faithful to their contract and covenant, the nature of which
they clearly understand before they enter into it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We believe it will be generally granted that the history
of the world does not furnish a single instance of any
religious institution which has stood fifty years without a
visible declension of the principles of the institution, in the
general purity and integrity of its members. This has been
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
generally acknowledged by the devotees of such institutions
and facts have fully verified it. But we would appeal to the
candid judgment of those who have known this institution
from the beginning, and have had a fair opportunity of observing
the progress of its improvement, whether they have,
in reality, found any declension, either in the external order
and regulations of the society, or in the purity and integrity
of its members, in the general practice of the moral and
Christian duties; and whether they have not, on the contrary,
discovered a visible and manifest increase in all these
respects. And hence they may judge for themselves, whether
the moral character of the society, and its progressive improvement,
can be ascribed to any other cause than the blessing,
protection, and government, of Divine Power and Wisdom.</q>

<p>
This denomination is also styled the <hi rend='italic'>millennial church</hi>.
Although celibacy is enjoined by the Shakers upon their
members, yet their numbers rather increase, by converts
from the world.
</p>

<p>
There are fifteen societies of Shakers in the United States,
located in the following places:&mdash;Alfred, New Gloucester,
and Poland, Me.; Canterbury and Enfield, N. H.; Shirley,
Harvard, Tyringham, and Hancock, Mass.; Enfield, Conn.;
Watervliet and New Lebanon, N. Y.; Union Village and
Watervliet, Ohio; Pleasant Hill and South Union, Ky. The
number of Shakers in the United States is about 6000.
</p>

<p>
This sect of Christians arose at Manchester, in England;
and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Ann Lee</hi> has the credit of being its founder. They
derive their name from their manner of worship, which is performed
by singing, dancing, and clapping their hands in regular
time, to a novel, but rather pleasant kind of music. This
sect was persecuted in England, and came to America in 1774.
They first settled in Watervliet, near Albany, N. Y. They
have, or think they have, revelations from Heaven, or gifts from
the Holy Spirit, which direct them in the choice of their leaders,
and in other important concerns. Their dress and manners
are similar to those of the society of Friends; hence they
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
are often called <hi rend='italic'>Shaking Quakers</hi>. They display great skill
and science in agriculture, horticulture, and the mechanic
arts; and their honesty, industry, hospitality, and neatness,
are proverbial. These people choose their locations with
great taste and judgment. A <hi rend='italic'>Shaker village</hi> always presents
a scene of beauty.
</p>

<p>
We close this article with an extract from a speech of the
Hon. John Breathitt, late governor of Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Much has been urged against Shakerism, much has been
said against their covenant; but, I repeat it, <emph>that</emph> individual
who is prepared to sign the church covenant, stands in an
enviable situation: his situation is, indeed, an enviable one,
who, devoted to God, is prepared to say of his property, <q>Here
it is, little or much; take it, and leave me unmolested to
commune with my God. Indeed, I dedicate myself to what?
not to a fanatical tenet; O, no! to a subject far beyond; to
the worship of Almighty God, the great Creator and Governor
of the universe. Under the influence of his love, I give
my all: only let me worship according to my faith, and in a
manner I believe acceptable to my God!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say again, the world cannot produce a parallel to the
situation which such a man exhibits&mdash;resigned to the will
of Heaven, free from all the feelings of earthly desire, and
pursuing, quietly, the peaceful tenor of his way.</q>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Reformation.</head>

<p>
This term is used, by way of eminence, to denote that
great change which took place in the Christian world, under
the ministry of Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Melancthon, and
others, who successfully opposed some of the doctrines, and
many of the practices, of the Roman church. It commenced
at Wittemberg, in Saxony, in 1517, and greatly weakened
the Papal authority.
</p>

<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>

<p>
It was from causes seemingly fortuitous, and from a source
very inconsiderable, that all the mighty effects of the reformation
flowed. Leo X., when raised to the Papal throne, in
1513, found the revenues of the church exhausted by the
vast projects of his two ambitious predecessors. His own
temper, naturally liberal and enterprising, rendered him incapable
of severe and patient economy; and his schemes for
aggrandizing the family of Medicis, his love of splendor, and
his munificence in rewarding men of genius, involved him
daily in new expenses, in order to provide a fund for which,
he tried every device that the fertile invention of priests had
fallen upon, to drain the credulous multitude of their wealth.
Among others, he had recourse to a sale of indulgences.
</p>

<p>
The Romish church believe that pious persons may do
works of supererogation, that is to say, more good works
than are necessary for their own salvation. All such works,
according to their doctrine, are deposited, together with the
infinite merits of Jesus Christ, in one inexhaustible treasury.
The keys of this were committed to St. Peter, and to his
successors the popes, who may open it at pleasure, and, by
transferring a portion of this superabundant merit to any
particular person for a sum of money, may convey to him
either pardon for his own sins, or a release for any one, for
whom he feels an interest, from the pains of purgatory.
Such indulgences were offered as a recompense for those
who engaged in the wars of the crusades against the Infidels.
Since those times, the power of granting indulgences has
been greatly abused in the church of Rome. Pope Leo X.,
finding that the sale of indulgences was likely to be lucrative,
granted to Albert, elector of Mentz and archbishop of Magdeburg,
the benefit of the indulgences of Saxony, and the
neighboring parts, and farmed out those of other countries to
the highest bidders; who, to make the best of their bargain,
procured the ablest preachers to cry up the value of the
commodity. The form of these indulgences was as follows.&mdash;<q>May
our Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon thee, and
absolve thee by the merits of his most holy passion. And I,
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
by his authority, that of his blessed apostles, Peter and Paul
and of the most holy pope, granted and committed to me in
these parts, do absolve thee, first, from all ecclesiastical censures,
in whatever manner they may have been incurred;
then from all thy sins, transgressions, and excesses, how
enormous soever they may be; even from such as are reserved
for the cognizance of the holy see, and as far as the
keys of the holy church extend. I remit to you all punishment
which you deserve in purgatory on their account; and
I restore you to the holy sacraments of the church, to the
unity of the faithful, and to that innocence and purity which
you possessed at baptism; so that, when you die, the gates of
punishment shall be shut, and the gates of the paradise of
delight shall be opened; and if you shall not die at present,
this grace shall remain in full force when you are at the
point of death. In the name of the Father, Son, and the
Holy Ghost.</q>
</p>

<p>
According to a book, called the <q>Tax of the Sacred Roman
Chancery,</q> in which are the exact sums to be levied for the
pardon of each particular sin, some of the fees are thus
stated:&mdash;For simony, 10<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi> 6<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>;
for sacrilege, 10<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi> 6<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>; for
taking a false oath, 9<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi>; for robbing,
12<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi>; for burning a
neighbor's house, 12<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi>;
for defiling a virgin, 9<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi>; for murdering
a layman, 7<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi> 6<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>;
for keeping a concubine, 10<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi> 6<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>; for
laying violent hands on a clergyman, 10<hi rend='italic'>s.</hi>
6<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The terms in which the retailers of these abominable
licenses described their advantages to the purchasers, and
the arguments with which they urged the necessity of obtaining
them, were so extravagant that they appear almost
incredible. <q>If any man,</q> said they, <q>purchase letters of indulgence,
his soul may rest secure with respect to its salvation.
The souls confined in purgatory, for whose redemption indulgences
are purchased, as soon as the money is paid, instantly
escape from that place of torment, and ascend into heaven.</q>
They said that the efficacy of indulgences was so great, that
the most heinous sins would be remitted and expiated by
them, and the person be freed both from punishment and
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
guilt: this was the unspeakable gift of God, in order to
reconcile man to himself; the cross erected by the preachers
of indulgences was equally efficacious with the cross of
Christ. <q>Lo,</q> said they, <q>the heavens are open; if you
enter not now, when will you enter? For twelve pence
you may redeem the soul of your father out of purgatory;
and are you so ungrateful that you will not rescue the
soul of your parent from torment? If you had but one coat,
you ought to strip yourself of that instantly, and sell it, in
order to purchase such benefit,</q> &amp;c.

It was against these preachers of licentiousness, and their
diabolical conduct, that Luther began first to declaim.

<head>Reformed Churches.</head>

<p>
The Reformed churches comprehend the whole Protestant
churches in Europe and America, whether Lutheran, Calvinistic,
Independent, Quaker, Baptist, or any other denomination
who dissent from the church of Rome. The
term <hi rend='italic'>Reformed</hi> is now, however, more particularly employed
to distinguish the Calvinists from the Lutherans.
</p>

<p>
The Reformed churches in America are the two following:&mdash;
</p>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Reformed Dutch Church.</head>

<p>
This is the oldest body of Presbyterians in America: it
descended immediately from the church of Holland; and, for
about a century from its commencement in this country, it
hung in colonial dependence on the Classis of Amsterdam,
and the Synod of North Holland, and was unable to ordain
a minister, or perform any ecclesiastical function of the kind,
without a reference to the parent country and mother church.
</p>

<p>
The origin of this church will lead us back to the earliest
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
history of the city and state of New York; for they were first
settled by this people, and by them a foundation was laid for
the first churches of this persuasion, the most distinguished
of which were planted at New York, (then called New
Amsterdam,) Flatbush, Esopus, and Albany. The church
at New York was probably the oldest, and was founded at,
or before, the year 1639; this is the earliest period to which
its records conduct us. The first minister was the Rev. Evarardus
Bogardus. But when he came from Holland, does
not appear. Next to him were two ministers by the name
of Megapolensis, John and Samuel.
</p>

<p>
The first place of worship built by the Dutch in the colony
of New Netherlands, as it was then called, was erected in
the fort at New York, in the year 1642. The second, it is
believed, was a chapel built by Governor Stuyvesant, in what
is now called the Bowery. In succession, churches of this
denomination arose on Long Island, in Schenectady, on
Staten Island, and in a number of towns on the Hudson
River, and several, it is believed, in New Jersey. But the
churches of New York, Albany, and Esopus, were the most
important, and the ministers of these churches claimed and
enjoyed a kind of episcopal dignity over the surrounding
churches.
</p>

<p>
The Dutch church was the established religion of the
colony, until it surrendered to the British in 1664; after
which its circumstances were materially changed. Not long
after the colony passed into the hands of the British, an act
was passed, which went to establish the Episcopal church as
the predominant party; and for almost a century after, the
Dutch and English Presbyterians, and all others in the colony,
were forced to contribute to the support of that church.
</p>

<p>
The first judicatory higher than a consistory, among this
people, was a Cœtus, formed in 1747. The object and
powers of this assembly were merely those of advice and
fraternal intercourse. It could not ordain ministers, nor
judicially decide in ecclesiastical disputes, without the consent
of the Classis of Amsterdam.
</p>

<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
The first regular Classis among the Dutch was formed in
1757. But the formation of this Classis involved this infant
church in the most unhappy collisions, which sometimes
threatened its very existence. These disputes continued for
many years, by which two parties were raised in the church,
one of which was for, and the other against, an ecclesiastical
subordination to the judicatories of the mother church and
country. These disputes, in which eminent men on both
sides were concerned, besides disturbing their own peace
and enjoyment, produced unfavorable impressions towards
them among their brethren at home.
</p>

<p>
In 1766, John H. Livingston, D. D., then a young man,
went from New York to Holland, to prosecute his studies in
the Dutch universities. By his representations, a favorable
disposition was produced towards the American church in
that country; and, on his return, in full convention of both
parties, an amicable adjustment of their differences was made
and a friendly correspondence was opened with the church
in Holland, which was continued until the revolution of the
country under Bonaparte.
</p>

<p>
The Dutch church suffered much in the loss of its members,
and in other respects, by persisting to maintain its
service in the Dutch language after it had gone greatly into
disuse. The solicitation for English preaching was long
resisted, and Dr. Laidlie, a native of Scotland, was the first
minister in the Dutch church in North America, who was
expressly called to officiate in the English language.

<head>Reformed German Church.</head>

<p>
As the Dutch Reformed church in this country is an exact
counterpart of the church of Holland, so the German Reformed
is of the Reformed or Calvinistic church of Germany.
The people of this persuasion were among the early
settlers of Pennsylvania: here their churches were first
formed; but they are now to be found in nearly all the states
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
south and west of the one above named. The German
Reformed churches in this country remained in a scattered
and neglected state until 1746, when the Rev. Michael
Schlatter, who was sent from Europe for the purpose, collected
them together, and put their concerns in a more prosperous
train. They have since increased to a numerous body, and
are assuming an important stand among the American Presbyterians.
</p>

<p>
This denomination is scattered over the Middle, Western,
and Southern States, but is most numerous in the states of
Ohio and Pennsylvania. The population of this church in
the United States is estimated at 300,000; 180 ministers, 600
congregations, and 30,000 communicants.

<head>Restorationists.</head>

<p>
The Restorationists are those who believe that all men will
ultimately become holy and happy. They maintain that God
created only to bless, and that, in pursuance of that purpose,
he sent his Son to <q>be for salvation to the ends of the earth;</q>
that Christ's kingdom is moral in its nature, and extends to
moral beings in every state or mode of existence; that the
probation of man is not confined to the present life, but
extends through the mediatorial reign; and that, as Christ
died for all, so, before he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to the Father, all shall be brought to a participation of the
knowledge and enjoyment of that truth which maketh free
from the bondage of sin and death. They believe in a general
resurrection and judgment, when those who have improved
their probation in this life will be raised to more
perfect felicity, and those who have misimproved their opportunities
on earth will come forward to shame and condemnation,
which will continue till they become truly penitent;
that punishment itself is a mediatorial work, a discipline,
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
perfectly consistent with mercy; that it is a means, employed
by Christ to humble and subdue the stubborn will, and prepare
the mind to receive a manifestation of the goodness of
God, which leadeth the sinner to true repentance. (See Gen.
12:3; 22:18. Gal. 3:8. Isa. 45:22, 23. Phil. 2:10,
11. Rev. 5:13. 1 Tim. 2:1-6. Col. 1:20. Eph. 1:7-11.
Rom. 5:12-21; 8:20, 21. 1 Cor. 15:24-28.)
</p>

<p>
They contend that this doctrine is not only sustained by
particular texts, but grows necessarily out of some of the first
principles of divine revelation. They maintain that it is immediately
connected with the perfections of the Deity; that
God, being infinitely benevolent, must have desired the happiness
of all his offspring; that his infinite wisdom would
enable him to form a perfect plan, and his almighty power
will secure its accomplishment. They contend that the
mission of Christ is abortive on any other plan, and that
nothing short of the <q>restitution of all things</q> can satisfy the
ardent desires of every pious soul. On this system alone can
they reconcile the attributes of justice and mercy, and secure
to the Almighty a character worthy of our imitation.
</p>

<p>
They insist that the words rendered <hi rend='italic'>everlasting</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>eternal</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>forever</hi>, which are, in a few instances, applied to the misery
of the wicked, do not prove that misery to be endless, because
these terms are loose in their signification, and are
frequently used in a limited sense; that the original terms,
being often used in the plural number, clearly demonstrate
that the period, though indefinite, is limited in its very nature.
They maintain that the meaning of the term must always be
sought in the subject to which it is applied, and that there is
nothing in the nature of punishment which will justify an
endless sense. They believe that the doctrine of the restoration
is the most consonant to the perfections of the Deity, the
most worthy of the character of Christ, and the only doctrine
which will accord with pious and devout feelings, or harmonize
with the Scriptures. They teach their followers that
ardent love to God, active benevolence to man, and personal
meekness and purity, are the natural results of these views.
</p>

<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>

<p>
Though the Restorationists, as a separate sect, have arisen
within a few years, their sentiments are by no means new.
Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Didymus of Alexandria,
Gregory Nyssen, and several others, among the Christian
fathers of the first four centuries, it is said, believed and advocated
the restoration of all fallen intelligences. A branch
of the German Baptists, before the reformation, held this
doctrine, and propagated it in Germany. Since the reformation,
this doctrine has had numerous advocates; and
some of them have been among the brightest ornaments of the
church. Among the Europeans, we may mention the names
of Jeremy White, of Trinity College, Dr. Burnet, Dr. Cheyne,
Chevalier Ramsay, Dr. Hartley, Bishop Newton, Mr. Stonehouse,
Mr. Petitpierre, Dr. Cogan, Mr. Lindsey, Dr. Priestley,
Dr. Jebb, Mr. Relly, Mr. Kenrick, Mr. Belsham, Dr. Southworth,
Smith, and many others. In fact, the restoration is the
commonly-received doctrine among the English Unitarians
at the present day. In Germany, a country which, for several
centuries, has taken the lead in all theological reforms, the
Orthodox have espoused this doctrine. The restoration was
introduced into America about the middle of the eighteenth
century, though it was not propagated much till about 1775
or 1780, when John Murray and Elhanan Winchester became
public advocates of this doctrine, and by their untiring
labors extended it in every direction. From that time to the
present, many men have been found, in all parts of our country,
who have rejoiced in this belief. This doctrine found
able advocates in the learned Dr. Chauncy, of Boston, Dr.
Rush, of Philadelphia, and Dr. Smith, of New York: Mr.
Foster, of New Hampshire, may also be mentioned as an
advocate of the restoration.
</p>

<p>
Most of the writers whose names are given above, did not
belong to a sect which took the distinctive name of Restorationists.
They were found in the ranks of the various sects
into which the Christian world has been divided. And those
who formed a distinct sect were more frequently denominated
Universalists than Restorationists. In 1785, a convention
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
was organized at Oxford, Massachusetts, under the auspices
of Messrs. Winchester and Murray. And as all who had
embraced universal salvation believed that the effects of sin
and the means of grace extended into a future life, the terms
<hi rend='italic'>Restorationist</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Universalist</hi> were then used as synonymous;
and those who formed that convention adopted the
latter as their distinctive name.
</p>

<p>
During the first twenty-five years, the members of the
Universalist convention were believers in a future retribution.
But, about the year 1818, Hosea Ballou, now of Boston, advanced
the doctrine that all retribution is confined to this
world. That sentiment, at first, was founded upon the old
Gnostic notion that all sin originates in the flesh, and that
death frees the soul from all impurity. Subsequently, some
of the advocates for the no-future punishment scheme adopted
the doctrine of materialism, and hence maintained that the
soul was mortal; that the whole man died a temporal death,
and that the resurrection was the grand event which would
introduce all men into heavenly felicity.
</p>

<p>
Those who have since taken to themselves the name of
Restorationists, viewed these innovations as corruptions of
the gospel, and raised their voices against them. But a
majority of the convention having espoused those sentiments,
no reformation could be effected. The Restorationists, believing
these errors to be increasing, and finding in the connection
what appeared to them to be a want of engagedness in
the cause of true piety, and in some instances an open opposition
to the organization of churches, and finding that a
spirit of levity and bitterness characterized the public labors
of their brethren, and that practices were springing up totally
repugnant to the principles of Congregationalism, resolved to
obey the apostolic injunction, by coming out from among
them, and forming an independent association. Accordingly
a convention, consisting of Rev. Paul Dean, Rev. David
Pickering, Rev. Charles Hudson, Rev. Adin Ballou, Rev.
Lyman Maynard, Rev. Nathaniel Wright, Rev. Philemon R.
Russell, and Rev. Seth Chandler, and several laymen, met at
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
Mendon, Massachusetts, August 17, 1831, and formed themselves
into a distinct sect, and took the name of <hi rend='italic'>Universal
Restorationists</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The Restorationists are Congregationalists on the subject
of church government.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the Restorationists and Universalists
relates principally to the subject of a future retribution.
The Universalists believe that a full and perfect retribution
takes place in this world, that our conduct here cannot affect
our future condition, and that the moment man exists after
death, he will be as pure and as happy as the angels. From
these views the Restorationists dissent. They maintain that
a just retribution does not take place in time; that the conscience
of the sinner becomes callous, and does not increase
in the severity of its reprovings with the increase of guilt;
that men are invited to act with reference to a future life;
that, if all are made perfectly happy at the commencement of
the next state of existence, they are not rewarded according
to their deeds; that, if death introduces them into heaven,
they are saved by death, and not by Christ; and if they are
made happy by being raised from the dead, they are saved by
physical, and not by moral means, and made happy without
their agency or consent; that such a sentiment weakens the
motives to virtue, and gives force to the temptations of vice;
that it is unreasonable in itself, and opposed to many passages
of Scripture. (See Acts 24:25; 17:30, 31. Heb. 9:27,
28. Matt. 11:23, 24. 2 Pet. 2:9. 2 Cor. 5:8-11.
John 5:28, 29. Matt. 10:28. Luke 12:4, 5; 16:19-31.
1 Pet. 3:18-20.)

The grand distinguishing characteristic of this class of
Christians is their belief in the final holiness and happiness

punishment for sin is endured in the present state of existence,
while others believe it extends into the future life; but

<div>
<head>History.</head>

<p>
Universalists claim that the salvation of all men was taught
by Jesus Christ and his apostles. It was also taught and
defended by several of the most eminent Christian fathers;
such as Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, &amp;c. In the third
and fourth centuries, this doctrine prevailed extensively, and,
for aught which appears to the contrary, was then accounted
orthodox. It was at length condemned, however, by the fifth
general council, A. D. 553; after which, we find few traces
of it through the dark ages, so called.
</p>

<p>
It revived at the period of the reformation, and since that
<pb n='097'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>
time has found many able and fearless advocates;&mdash;in Switzerland,
Petitpierre and Lavater; in Germany, Seigvolk,
Everhard, Steinbart, and Semler; in Scotland, Purves,
Douglass, and T. S. Smith; in England, Coppin, Jeremy
White, Dr. H. More, Dr. T. Burnet, Whiston, Hartley,
Bishop Newton, Stonehouse, Barbauld, Lindsey, Priestley,
Belsham, Carpenter, Relly, Vidler, Scarlett, and many others.
</p>

<p>
At the present day, Universalism prevails more extensively
than elsewhere in England, Germany, and the United States.
</p>

<p>
In England, the Unitarian divines, generally, believe in the
final salvation of all men. Dr. Lant Carpenter says, <q>Most
of us, however, believe that a period will come to each individual,
when punishment shall have done its work&mdash;when
the awful sufferings with which the gospel threatens the impenitent
and disobedient, will have humbled the stubborn,
purified the polluted, and eradicated malignity, impiety, hypocrisy,
and every evil disposition; that a period will come
(which it may be the unspeakable bliss of those who enter
the joy of their Lord to accelerate, which, at least, it will be
their delight to anticipate,) when he who <q>must reign till he
hath put <emph>all enemies</emph> under his feet,</q> <q>shall have put down all
rule, and all authority, and power.</q> <q>The <hi rend='smallcaps'>last enemy</hi>,
death, shall be <hi rend='smallcaps'>destroyed</hi>.</q> <q>Every tongue shall confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</q>
<q>who wills that all men should be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth,</q>&mdash;that truth which sanctifies the
heart,&mdash;that knowledge which is life eternal,&mdash;and God
shall be <hi rend='smallcaps'>all in all</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
In Germany, nearly every theologian is a believer in the
final salvation of all men. Speaking of Professor Tholuck,
Professor Sears says, <q>The most painful disclosures remain
yet to be made. This distinguished and excellent man,
in common with the <emph>great majority of the Evangelical divines</emph>
of Germany, though he professes to have serious doubts, and
is cautious in avowing the sentiment, believes that all men
and fallen spirits will finally be saved.</q> Mr. Dwight, in his
recent publication, says, <q>The doctrine of the eternity of
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
future punishments is almost universally rejected. I have
seen but one person in Germany who believed it, and but one
other whose mind was wavering on this subject.</q> Universalism
may, therefore, be considered the prevailing religion
in Germany.
</p>

<p>
In the United States, Universalism was little known until
about the middle of the last century; and afterwards it found
but few advocates during several years. Dr. George de
Benneville, of Germantown, Penn., Rev. Richard Clarke, of
Charleston, S. C., and Jonathan Mayhew, D. D., of Boston,
were, perhaps, the only individuals who publicly preached
the doctrine before the arrival of Rev. John Murray, in 1770.
Mr. Murray labored almost alone until 1780, when Rev.
Elhanan Winchester, a popular Baptist preacher, embraced
Universalism, though on different principles. About ten
years afterwards, Rev. Hosea Ballou embraced the same
doctrine, but on principles different from those advocated by
Mr. Murray or Mr. Winchester. To the efforts of these three
men is to be attributed much of the success which attended
the denomination in its infancy. Although they differed
widely from each other in their views of punishment, yet they
labored together in harmony and love, for the advancement
of the cause which was dear to all their hearts. The seed
which they sowed has since produced an abundant harvest.
</p>

<p>
The ministry of the Universalist denomination in the
United States, hitherto, has been provided for, not so much
by the means of schools, as by the unaided, but irresistible
influence of the gospel of Christ. This has furnished the
denomination with its most successful preachers. It has
turned them from other sects and doctrines, and brought
them out from forests and fields, and from secular pursuits
of almost every kind, and driven them, with inadequate literary
preparation, to the work of disseminating the truth.
This state of things has been unavoidable, and the effect of
it is visible. It has made the ministry of the Universalist
denomination very different from that of any other sect in
the country; studious of the Scriptures, confident in the
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
truth of their distinguishing doctrine, zealous, firm, industrious;
depending more on the truths communicated for
their success, than on the manner in which they are stated.
It has had the effect, also, to give the ministry a polemic
character&mdash;the natural result of unwavering faith in the
doctrine believed, and of an introduction into the desk without
scholastic training. But the attention of the denomination,
in various parts of the country, has of late been turned
to the education of the ministry; and conventions and associations
have adopted resolves requiring candidates to pass
examinations in certain branches of literature. The same
motives have governed many in their effort to establish
literary and theological institutions. The desire to have
the ministry respectable for literary acquirements, is universal.
</p>

<p>
A few years since, a small number separated from the
denomination, and adopted the appellation of <hi rend='italic'>Restorationists</hi>.
To prevent misapprehension, it may be repeated, that,
although a few have thus seceded, yet a difference of opinion
in regard to the duration of punishment has not disturbed
the harmony of the denomination generally, nor is it regarded
as sufficient cause for breach of fellowship, or alienation
of heart and affection.
</p>

<p>
The Universalists quote the following texts of Scripture,
among others, in support of their sentiments:&mdash;Gen.
22:18. Ps. 22:27; 86:9. Isa. 25:6, 7, 8; 45:23, 24.
Jer. 31:33, 34. Lam. 3:31-33. John 12:32. Acts
3:31. Rom. 5:18, 21; 8:33, 39; 11:25-36. 1 Cor.
15:22-28, and 51-57. 2 Cor. 5:18, 19. Gal. 3:8.
Eph. 1:9, 10. Phil. 2:9-11. Col. 1:19, 29. 1 Tim.
2:1-6. Heb. 8:10, 11. Rev. 5:13; 21:3, 4.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
We copy the following from the <hi rend='italic'>Trumpet and Universalist
Magazine</hi> of June 4, 1836. It is by the Rev. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Hosea
Ballou</hi>, of Boston, in answer to the question, <q>Who are
Universalists?</q>
</p>

<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There seems to be an evident propriety in calling all who
believe in the final holiness and happiness of all mankind,
<hi rend='italic'>Universalists</hi>. There appears no good reason why those
who believe in a limited punishment, in the future state,
should have a less or a greater claim to be called Universalists,
than those who entertain a hope that all sin and misery
end when the functions of life cease in the mortal body.
As they both agree in the belief that God is the Savior of
all men, if this belief entitle one to the name of Universalist,
of course it gives the other the same title. The Rev. John
Murray was called a Universalist, and he called himself by
this name, although he admitted there might be suffering
hereafter, in consequence of blindness or unbelief. It is
true, he did not allow that the sinner was punished for sin,
either here or in the future world, in his own person, because
he maintained that the whole penalty of the divine law, for
the sin of the whole world, was suffered by the Lord Jesus,
as the head of every man. He allowed, notwithstanding,
that the natural consequences of sin would inevitably follow
transgression, as we see is the case by every day's observation.
So, likewise, was the Rev. Elhanan Winchester called
a Universalist, and he called himself so, although his views
respecting a state of retribution, and the sufferings to which
the wicked in the world to come will be subjected, were
widely different from those entertained by Mr. Murray. Mr.
Winchester believed in a place of material fire and brimstone,
where the wicked would endure a torment as intense
as has been represented by those Christians who believe in
endless misery. But, as he believed that all these sufferings
will end, though they might continue for many thousand
years, and that those miserable wretches will at last be subdued
and reconciled to the divine government, and be happy,
he was denominated a Universalist.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Rev. Dr. Huntington is ranked a Universalist,
equally with those who have been named; but he believed
in no punishment hereafter, being Calvinistic in his views of
the demerit of sin, and of the atonement made by Christ.</q>
</p>

<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>From the commencement of the denomination of Univeralists
in this country, there has been a difference of opinion
respecting the doctrine of rewards and punishments, among
both the clergy and the laity belonging to the connection.
But this difference was not considered, in those times, a good
reason for a distinction of either name, denomination, or fellowship.
All united in the cheering hope that, in the fulness
of the dispensation of times, sin will be finished, transgression
ended, and all moral intelligences reconciled to God, in true
holiness and everlasting happiness. A view so grand and
glorious, so full of comfort, of joy, and of peace, and so triumphant,
was sufficiently powerful to draw together all who
enjoyed it, and to hold them together as a denomination
distinct from all those who hold the unmerciful doctrine of
endless punishment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When the General Convention of the New England States,
professing the doctrine of universal salvation, appointed a
committee to draft articles of faith and a constitution, by
which it might be known and distinguished from other religious
sects, care was taken to appoint on that committee
brethren whose views differed respecting the subject of a
future state of rewards and punishments. The worthy and
fondly-remembered brother Walter Ferriss, who penned that
instrument, was a believer in future rewards and punishments;
but he so wrote that confession of faith as to comprehend the
full belief of universal salvation, without making any distinction
between the belief of future punishment, or no future
punishment. And it is well remembered that this circumstance
was, at the time of accepting the report of the committee,
</q>viewed as one of its excellences.
</p>

<p>
<q>It seems improper to give so much weight to different
opinions, which differ not in principle, but in circumstances
only, as to constitute them walls of separation and disfellowship.
If one believe that all misery ends with this mortal
state, and another believe that it may continue twenty years
after, and then come to an end, is there any real difference
as to principle? All believe that our heavenly Father holds
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
all times and seasons, and all events, in his own power, and
that he worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.
And, moreover, all believe that God will have all men to be
saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. This
constitutes us all Universalists, and calls on us to keep the
unity of the spirit, and to walk in the bonds of peace.</q>

<q rend='pre'>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary

<q rend='pre'>Which faith except every one do keep entire and inviolate,
without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</q>
</p>

<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, the Catholic faith is this&mdash;that we worship one God
in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For one is the person of the Father, another of the Son,
another of the Holy Ghost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the
Holy Ghost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, and the
Holy Ghost uncreated.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible,
and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost
eternal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And yet they are not three Eternals, but one Eternal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As also they are not three Uncreated, nor three Incomprehensibles;
but one Uncreated, and one Incomprehensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In like manner, the Father is almighty, the Son almighty,
and the Holy Ghost almighty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy
Ghost is God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the
Holy Ghost is Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord,</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For, as we are compelled by the Christian truth to acknowledge
every person by himself to be God and Lord,</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to say there
are three Gods or three Lords.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Father is made of no one, neither created nor begotten.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Son is from the Father alone, not made, nor created,
but begotten.</q>
</p>

<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son, not
made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not
three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And in this Trinity there is nothing before or after,
nothing greater or less; but the whole three Persons are co-eternal
to one another, and coëqual.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So that in all things, as has been already said above, the
Unity is to be worshipped in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He, therefore, that will be saved, must thus think of the
Trinity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation, that
he also believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, the right faith is, that we believe and confess that
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and
Man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He is God of the substance of his Father, begotten before
the world; and he is Man of the substance of his mother,
born in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Perfect God and perfect Man; of a rational soul, and
human flesh subsisting.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Equal to the Father according to his Godhead, and less
than the Father according to his Manhood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Who, although he be both God and Man, yet he is not
two, but one Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>One, not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh,
but by the taking of the Manhood unto God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by
unity of person.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For as the rational soul and the flesh is one man, so God
and Man is one Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose
again the third day from the dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He ascended into heaven: he sitteth at the right hand

This Creed was adopted at Constantinople, A. D. 381. It

The foregoing Creeds are copied from Catholic books.

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

The Catholics, both in Europe and America, acknowledge
the following Rule is <q>all that, and only that, belongs to
Catholic belief, which is revealed in the word of God, and
which is proposed by the Catholic church to all its members
to be believed with divine faith.</q>
</p>

<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>

<p>
<q>Guided by this certain criterion,</q> they say, <q rend='pre'>we profess
to believe,</q>
</p>

<p>
1. <q rend='pre'>That Christ has established a church upon earth,
and that this church is that which holds communion
with the see of Rome, being one, holy, Catholic, and
apostolical.</q>
</p>

<p>
2. <q rend='pre'>That we are obliged to hear this church; and, therefore,
that she is infallible, by the guidance of Almighty God,
in her decisions regarding faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
3. <q rend='pre'>That St. Peter, by divine commission, was appointed
the head of this church, under Christ, its Founder;
and that the pope, or bishop of Rome, as successor to St.
Peter, has always been, and is, at present, by divine right,
head of this church.</q>
</p>

<p>
4. <q rend='pre'>That the canon of the Old and New Testament, as
proposed to us by this church, is the word of God; as also
such traditions, belonging to faith and morals, which, being
originally delivered by Christ to his apostles, have been preserved
by constant succession.</q>
</p>

<p>
5. <q rend='pre'>That honor and veneration are due to the angels of
God and his saints; that they offer up prayers to God for us;
that it is good and profitable to have recourse to their intercession;
and that the relics, or earthly remains, of God's
particular servants, are to be held in respect.</q>
</p>

<p>
6. <q rend='pre'>That no sins ever were, or can be, remitted, unless
by the mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and, therefore,
that man's justification is the work of divine grace.</q>
</p>

<p>
7. <q rend='pre'>That the good works which we do, receive their
whole value from the grace of God; and that, by such works,
we not only comply with the precepts of the divine law, but
that we thereby likewise merit eternal life.</q>
</p>

<p>
8. <q rend='pre'>That, by works done in the spirit of penance, we can
make satisfaction to God for the temporal punishment which
often remains due, after our sins, by the divine goodness,
have been forgiven us.</q>
</p>

<p>
9. <q rend='pre'>That Christ has left to his church a power of
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
granting indulgences, that is, a relaxation from such temporal
chastisement only, as remains due after the divine
pardon of sin; and that the use of such indulgences is
profitable to sinners.</q>
</p>

<p>
10. <q rend='pre'>That there is a purgatory, or middle state; and that
the souls of imperfect Christians, therein detained, are helped
by the prayers of the faithful.</q>
</p>

<p>
11. <q rend='pre'>That there are seven sacraments, all instituted by
Christ&mdash;baptism, confirmation, eucharist, penance, extreme
unction, holy order, matrimony.</q>
</p>

<p>
12. <q rend='pre'>That, in the most holy sacrament of the eucharist,
there is truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood,
together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
13. <q rend='pre'>That, in this sacrament, there is, by the omnipotence
of God, a conversion, or change, of the whole substance of
the bread into the body of Christ, and of the whole substance
of the wine into his blood, which change we call
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Transubstantiation</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
14. <q rend='pre'>That, under either kind, Christ is received whole
and entire.</q>
</p>

<p>
15. <q rend='pre'>That, in the mass, or sacrifice of the altar, is offered
to God a true, proper, and propitiatory, sacrifice for the living
and the dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
16. <q rend='pre'>That, in the sacrament of penance, the sins we fall
into after baptism are, by the divine mercy, forgiven us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>These are the great points of Catholic belief, by which
we are distinguished from other Christian societies; and
these, only, are the real and essential tenets of our religion.
We admit, also, the other grand articles of revealed and natural
religion, which the gospel and the light of reason have
manifested to us. To these we submit, as men and as Christians,
and to the former as obedient children of the Catholic
church.</q>

<head>Bereans.</head>

<p>
The Bereans are a sect of Protestant dissenters from the
church of Scotland, who take their title from, and profess
to follow the example of, the ancient Bereans, in building
their system of faith and practice upon the Scriptures alone,
without regard to any human authority whatever. The Bereans
first assembled, as a separate society of Christians, in
the city of Edinburgh, in the autumn of 1773. Mr. Barclay,
a Scotch clergyman, was the founder of this sect.
</p>

<p>
The Bereans agree with the great majority of Christians
respecting the doctrine of the Trinity, which they hold as a
fundamental article; and they also agree, in a great measure,
with the professed principles of our Orthodox churches,
respecting predestination and election, though they allege
that these doctrines are not consistently taught. But they
differ from the majority of all sects of Christians in various
other important particulars, such as,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. Respecting our knowledge of the Deity. Upon this
subject, they say the majority of professed Christians stumble
at the very threshold of revelation; and, by admitting the
doctrine of natural religion, natural conscience, natural
notices, &amp;c., not founded upon revelation, or derived from it
by tradition, they give up the cause of Christianity at once
to the infidels, who may justly argue, as Mr. Paine, in fact,
does, in his <q>Age of Reason,</q> that there is no occasion for
any revelation or word of God, if man can discover his nature
and perfections from his works alone. But this, the Bereans
argue, is beyond the natural powers of human reason; and,
therefore, our knowledge of God is from revelation alone;
and, without revelation, man would never have entertained
an idea of his existence.
</p>

<p>
2. With regard to faith in Christ, and assurance of salvation
through his merits, they differ from almost all other sects
whatsoever. These they reckon inseparable, or rather the
same, because (they say) <q>God hath expressly declared, He
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
that believeth shall be saved; and, therefore, it is not only
absurd, but impious, and, in a manner, calling God a liar, for
a man to say, <q>I believe the gospel, but have doubts, nevertheless,
of my own salvation.</q></q> With regard to the various
distinctions and definitions that have been given of different
kinds of faith, they argue that there is nothing incomprehensible
or obscure in the meaning of this word, as used in
Scripture; but that, as faith, when applied to human testimony,
signifies neither more nor less than the mere simple
belief of that testimony as true, upon the authority of the
testifier, so, when applied to the testimony of God, it signifies
precisely <q>the belief of his testimony, and resting upon his
veracity alone, without any kind of collateral support from
concurrence of any other evidence or testimony whatever.</q>
And they insist that, as this faith is the gift of God alone, so
the person to whom it is given is as conscious of possessing
it, as the being to whom God gives life is of being alive; and,
therefore, he entertains no doubts, either of his faith, or his
consequent salvation through the merits of Christ, who died
and rose again for that purpose. In a word, they argue that
the gospel would not be what it is held forth to be,&mdash;glad
tidings of great joy,&mdash;if it did not bring full personal assurance
of eternal salvation to the believer; which assurance,
they insist, is the present infallible privilege and portion of
every individual believer of the gospel.
</p>

<p>
3. Consistently with the above definition of faith, they say
that the sin against the Holy Ghost, which has alarmed and
puzzled so many in all ages, is nothing else but unbelief; and
that the expression, <q>it shall not be forgiven, neither in this
world nor that which is to come,</q> means only that a person
dying in infidelity would not be forgiven, neither under the
former dispensation by Moses, (the then present dispensation,
kingdom, or government, of God,) nor under the gospel dispensation,
which, in respect of the Mosaic, was a kind of
future world, or kingdom to come.
</p>

<p>
4. The Bereans interpret a great part of the Old Testament
prophecies, and, in particular, the whole of the Psalms,
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
excepting such as are merely historical or laudatory, to be
typical or prophetical of Jesus Christ, his sufferings, atonement,
mediation, and kingdom; and they esteem it a gross
perversion of these psalms and prophecies, to apply them to
the experiences of private Christians. In proof of this, they
not only urge the words of the apostle, that no prophecy is
of any private interpretation, but they insist that the whole
of the quotations from the ancient prophecies in the New
Testament, and particularly those from the Psalms, are expressly
applied to Christ. In this opinion, many other classes
of Protestants agree with them.
</p>

<p>
5. Of the absolute, all-superintending sovereignty of the
Almighty, the Bereans entertain the highest idea, as well as
of the uninterrupted exertion thereof over all his works, in
heaven, earth, and hell, however unsearchable by his creatures.
A God without election, they argue, or choice in all
his works, is a God without existence, a mere idol, a nonentity.
And to deny God's election, purpose, and express will,
in all his works, is to make him inferior to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
The Bereans consider infant baptism as a divine ordinance,
instituted in the room of circumcision, and think it absurd
to suppose that infants, who, all agree, are admissible to the
kingdom of God in heaven, should, nevertheless, be incapable
of being admitted into his visible church on earth.
</p>

<p>
They commemorate the Lord's supper generally once a
month; but, as the words of the institution fix no particular
period, they sometimes celebrate it oftener, and sometimes at
more distant periods, as it may suit their general convenience.
They meet every Lord's day, for the purpose of preaching,
praying, and exhorting to love and good works. With regard
to admission and exclusion of members, their method is
very simple: when any person, after hearing the Berean doctrines,
professes his belief and assurance of the truths of the
gospel, and desires to be admitted into their communion, he
is cheerfully received, upon his profession, whatever may have
been his former manner of life. But, if such a one should
afterwards draw back from his good profession or practice,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
they first admonish him, and, if that has no effect, they leave
him to himself. They do not think that they have any power
to deliver a backsliding brother to Satan; that text, and
other similar passages, such as, <q>Whatsoever ye shall bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven,</q> &amp;c., they consider as restricted
to the apostles, and to the inspired testimony alone,
and not to be extended to any church on earth, or any number
of churches, or of Christians, whether decided by a majority
of votes, or by unanimous voices. Neither do they
think themselves authorized, as a Christian church, to inquire
into each other's political opinions, any more than to examine
into each other's notions of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
They both recommend and practise, as a Christian duty,
submission to lawful authority; but they do not think that a
man, by becoming a Christian, or joining their society, is
under any obligation, by the rules of the gospel, to renounce
his right of private judgment upon matters of public or private
importance. Upon all such subjects, they allow each
other to think and act as each may see it his duty; and they
require nothing more of the members, than a uniform and
steady profession of the apostolic faith, and a suitable walk
and conversation. (See Acts 17:11. Rom. 10:9.)
</p>

<p>
The Berean doctrines have found converts in various parts
of Europe and America.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Materialists.</head>

<p>
Materialists are those who maintain that the soul of man
is material, or that the principle of perception and thought is
not a substance distinct from the body, but the result of
corporeal organization. There are others called by this name
who have maintained that there is nothing but matter in the
universe.
</p>

<p>
The followers of the late Dr. Priestley are considered as
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
Materialists, or philosophical Necessarians. According to
the doctor's writings, he believed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. That man is no more than what we now see of him;
his being commenced at the time of his conception, or perhaps
at an earlier period. The corporeal and mental faculties,
inhering in the same substance, grow, ripen, and decay
together; and whenever the system is dissolved, it continues
in a state of dissolution, till it shall please that Almighty Being
who called it into existence, to restore it to life again.
For if the mental principle were, in its own nature, immaterial
and immortal, all its peculiar faculties would be so too;
whereas we see that every faculty of the mind, without exception,
is liable to be impaired, and even to become wholly
extinct, before death. Since, therefore, all the faculties of
the mind, separately taken, appear to be mortal, the substance
or principle, in which they exist, must be pronounced mortal
too. Thus we might conclude that the body was mortal,
from observing that all the separate senses and limbs were
liable to decay and perish.
</p>

<p>
This system gives a real value to the doctrine of the resurrection
from the dead, which is peculiar to revelation; on
which alone the sacred writers build all our hope of future
life; and it explains the uniform language of the Scriptures,
which speak of one day of judgment for all mankind, and
represent all the rewards of virtue, and all the punishments of
vice, as taking place at that awful day, and not before. In
the Scriptures, the heathen are represented as without hope,
and all mankind as perishing at death, if there be no resurrection
of the dead.
</p>

<p>
The apostle Paul asserts, in 1 Cor. 15:16, that <q>if the
dead rise not, then is not Christ risen; and if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your sins: then they
also who are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</q> And
again, verse 32, <q>If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die.</q> In the whole discourse, he does not
even mention the doctrine of happiness or misery without the
body.
</p>

<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>

<p>
If we search the Scriptures for passages expressive of the
state of man at death, we shall find such declarations as expressly
exclude any trace of sense, thought, or enjoyment.
(See Ps. 6:5. Job 14:7, &amp;c.)
</p>

<p>
2. That there is some fixed law of nature respecting the
will, as well as the other powers of the mind, and every thing
else in the constitution of nature; and consequently that it is
never determined without some real or apparent cause foreign
to itself, i. e., without some motive of choice; or that motives
influence us in some definite and invariable manner,
so that every volition, or choice, is constantly regulated and
determined by what precedes it; and this constant determination
of mind, according to the motives presented to it, is
what is meant by its <hi rend='italic'>necessary determination</hi>. This being
admitted to be fact, there will be a necessary connection between
all things past, present, and to come, in the way of
proper cause and effect, as much in the intellectual as in the
natural world; so that, according to the established laws of
nature, no event could have been otherwise than it <emph>has been</emph>,
or <emph>is to be</emph>, and therefore all things past, present, and to come,
are precisely what the Author of Nature really intended them
to be, and has made provision for.
</p>

<p>
To establish this conclusion, nothing is necessary but that
throughout all nature the same consequences should invariably
result from the same circumstances. For if this be admitted,
it will necessarily follow that, at the commencement
of any system, since the several parts of it, and their respective
situations, were appointed by the Deity, the first change
would take place according to a certain rule established by
himself, the result of which would be a new situation; after
which the same laws containing another change would succeed,
according to the same rules, and so on forever; every
new situation invariably leading to another, and every event,
from the commencement to the termination of the system,
being strictly connected, so that, unless the fundamental laws
of the system were changed, it would be impossible that any
event should have been otherwise than it was. In all these
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
cases, the circumstances preceding any change are called the
causes of that change; and, since a determinate event, or
effect, constantly follows certain circumstances, or causes,
the connection between cause and effect is concluded to be
invariable, and therefore necessary.
</p>

<p>
It is universally acknowledged that there can be no effect
without an adequate cause. This is even the foundation on
which the only proper argument for the being of a God rests.
And the Necessarian asserts that if, in any given state of
mind, with respect both to dispositions and motives, two
different determinations, or volitions, be possible, it can be
on no other principle, than that one of them should come
under the description of an effect without a cause; just as if
the beam of a balance might incline either way, though loaded
with equal weights. And if any thing whatever&mdash;even
a thought in the mind of man&mdash;could arise without an adequate
cause, any thing else&mdash;the mind itself, or the whole
universe&mdash;might likewise exist without an adequate cause.
</p>

<p>
This scheme of philosophical necessity implies a chain of
causes and effects established by infinite wisdom, and terminating
in the greatest good of the whole universe; evils of all
kinds, natural and moral, being admitted, as far as they contribute
to that end, or are in the nature of things inseparable
from it. Vice is productive, not of good, but of evil, to us,
both here and hereafter, though good may result from it to
the whole system; and, according to the fixed laws of nature,
our present and future happiness necessarily depends on our
cultivating good dispositions.

<head>Arminians.</head>

<p>
Those persons who follow the doctrines of Arminius, who
was pastor at Amsterdam, and afterwards professor of divinity
at Leyden. Arminius had been educated in the opinions of
Calvin; but, thinking the doctrine of that great man, with
regard to free will, predestination, and grace, too severe, he
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
began to express his doubts concerning them in the year
1591, and, upon further inquiry, adopted the sentiments of
those whose religious system extends the love of the Supreme
Being and the merits of Jesus Christ to all mankind.
</p>

<p>
The distinguishing tenets of the Arminians may be comprised
in the five following articles relative to predestination,
universal redemption, the corruption of man, conversion, and
perseverance, viz.:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That God determined to bestow pardon and present
salvation on all who repent and believe in Christ, and final
salvation on all who persevere to the end, and to inflict everlasting
punishment on those who should continue in their
unbelief, and resist his divine succors; so that election was
conditional, and reprobation, in like manner, the result of
foreseen infidelity and persevering wickedness, (See Ezek.
18:30-32. Acts 17:24-30. Matt. 23:37. Rom. 2:4,
5; 5:18. 1 Tim. 11:1-4. 2 Pet. 1:10; 3:9.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That Jesus Christ, by his sufferings and death, made
an atonement for the sins of all mankind in general, and of
every individual in particular; that, however, none but those
who believe in him can be partakers of divine benefits. (See
John 2:2; 3:16, 17. Heb. 2:9. Isa. 50:19, 20. 1
Cor. 8:11.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That true faith cannot proceed from the exercise of
our natural faculties and powers, nor from the force and
operation of free will; since man, in consequence of his natural
corruption, is incapable either of thinking or doing any
good thing; and that, therefore, it is necessary, in order to
his conversion and salvation, that he be regenerated and renewed
by the operation of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift
of God through Jesus Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That this divine grace, or energy, of the Holy Ghost,
begins and perfects every thing that can be called good in
man, and, consequently, all good works are to be attributed
to God alone; that, nevertheless, this grace is offered to all,
and does not force men to act against their inclinations, but
may be resisted, and rendered ineffectual, by the perverse will
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
of the impenitent sinner. Some modern Arminians interpret
this and the last article with a greater latitude. (See Isa. 1:16.
Deut. 10:16. Eph. 4:22.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>5. That God gives to the truly faithful, who are regenerated
by his grace, the means of preserving themselves in this
state.</q>
</p>

</quote>

<p>
The first Armenians, indeed, had some doubt with
respect to the closing part of the latter article; but their
followers uniformly maintain, <q>that the regenerate may lose
true, justifying faith, fall from a state of grace, and die in their
sins.</q> (See Heb. 6:4-6. 2 Pet. 2:20, 21. Luke 21:35.
2 Pet. 3:17.)
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Methodists, Or The Methodist Episcopal Church.</head>

<p>
This denomination arose in England, in 1729, and derived
their name from the exact regularity of their lives. In 1741,
they divided into two parties, under George Whitefield and
John Wesley. The former adopted the sentiments of Calvin,
and the latter those of Arminius. The Arminian class compose
the great body of Methodists in this country and in
Great Britain. Both of those men were eminently distinguished
for the variety and extent of their labors.
</p>

<p>
The following are the articles of religion, as published in
the <q>Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal
Church:</q>&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. There is but one living and true God, everlasting,
without body or parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness;
the Maker and Preserver of all things, visible and invisible.
And in unity of this Godhead, there are three persons,
of one substance, power and eternity&mdash;the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost.</q>
</p>

<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. The Son, who is the Word of the Father, the very and
eternal God, of one substance with the Father, took man's
nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin; so that two whole
and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and manhood,
were joined together in one person, never to be divided,
whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly
suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his
Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt,
but also for the actual sins of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. Christ did truly rise again from the dead, and took
again his body, with all things appertaining to the perfection
of man's nature, wherewith he ascended into heaven, and
there sitteth, until he return to judge all men at the last day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the
Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father
and the Son, very and eternal God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. The holy Scriptures contain all things necessary to
salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be
proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it
should be believed as an article of faith, or be thought requisite
or necessary to salvation. By the name of the holy
Scriptures, we do understand those canonical books of the
Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any
doubt in the church. [Here follow the names of the canonical
books of the Scriptures.]</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. The Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for,
both in the Old and New Testament, everlasting life is
offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between
God and man, being both God and man. Wherefore
they are not to be heard, who feign that the old fathers did
look only for transitory promises. Although the law given
from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, doth
not bind Christians, nor ought the civil precepts thereof of
necessity to be received in any commonwealth, yet, notwithstanding,
no Christian whatsoever is free from the obedience
of the commandments which are called moral.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as
the Pelagians do vainly talk,) but it is the corruption of the
<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>
nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring
of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original
righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that
continually.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. The condition of man, after the fall of Adam, is such,
that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural
strength and works, to faith, and calling upon God; wherefore
we have no power to do good works, pleasant and acceptable
to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing
us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when
we have that good will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. We are accounted righteous before God, only for
the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by faith, and
not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore, that we
are justified by faith only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and
very full of comfort.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. Although good works, which are the fruits of faith,
and follow after justification, cannot put away our sins, and
endure the severity of God's judgments, yet are they pleasing
and acceptable to God in Christ, and spring out of a true
and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may
be as evidently known, as a tree is discerned by its fruit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>11. Voluntary works, being over and above God's commandments,
which are called works of supererogation, cannot
be taught without arrogancy and impiety. For by them men
do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as
they are bound to do, but they do more for his sake than of
bounden duty is required; whereas Christ saith plainly,
<q>When ye have done all that is commanded you, say, We
are unprofitable servants.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>12. Not every sin willingly committed after justification,
is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore,
the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as
fall into sin after justification; after we have received the
Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into
sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again, and amend our lives.
And, therefore, they are to be condemned who say they can
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of
forgiveness to such as truly repent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>13. The visible church of Christ is a congregation of
faithful men, in which the pure word of God is preached, and
the sacraments duly administered according to Christ's ordinance,
in all those things that of necessity are requisite to
the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>14. The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon,
worshipping and adoration as well of images as of relics,
and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented,
and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant
to the word of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>15. It is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God,
and the custom of the primitive church, to have public prayer
in the church, or to minister the sacraments, in a tongue not
understood by the people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>16. Sacraments ordained of Christ are not only badges
or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather they are
certain signs of grace, and God's good-will towards us, by
the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only
quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are two sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord to
the gospel; that is to say, baptism and the supper of the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Those five commonly called <hi rend='italic'>sacraments</hi>&mdash;that is
to say, confirmation, penance, orders, matrimony, and extreme
unction&mdash;are not to be counted for sacraments of the gospel,
being such as have partly grown out of the <emph>corrupt</emph> following
of the apostles, and partly are states of life allowed in the
Scriptures, but yet have not the like nature of baptism and
the Lord's supper, because they have not any visible sign
or ceremony ordained of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed
upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use
them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they
have a wholesome effect or operation; but they that receive
them unworthily, purchase to themselves condemnation, as
St. Paul saith. (1 Cor. 11:29.)</q>
</p>

<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>17. Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of
difference, whereby Christians are distinguished from others
that are not baptized, but it is also a sign of regeneration, or
the new birth. The baptism of young children is to be
retained in the church.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>18. The supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love
that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another,
but rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death;
insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith,
receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of
the body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking
of the blood of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of
bread and wine in the supper of our Lord, cannot be proved by
Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,
overthroweth the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occasion
to many superstitions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the supper,
only after a heavenly and scriptural manner. And the
means whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in
the supper, is faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The sacrament of the Lord's supper was not by Christ's
ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>19. The cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay
people; for both the parts of the Lord's supper, by Christ's
ordinance and commandment, ought to be administered to all
Christians alike.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>20. The offering of Christ, once made, is that perfect
redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins
of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is
none other satisfaction for sin but that alone. Wherefore
the sacrifice of masses, in the which it is commonly said that
the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to
have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable and
dangerous deceit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>21. The ministers of Christ were not commanded by God's
<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>
law either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstract from
marriage; therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other
Christians, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall
judge the same to serve best to godliness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>22. It is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in
all places be the same, or exactly alike; for they have been
always different, and may be changed according to the diversity
of countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing
be ordained against God's word. Whosoever, through his
private judgment, willingly and purposely doth openly break
the rites and ceremonies of the church to which he belongs,
which are not repugnant to the word of God, and are ordained
and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked
openly, that others may fear to do the like, as one that offendeth
against the common order of the church, and woundeth
the consciences of weak brethren.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Every particular church may ordain, change, and abolish,
rites and ceremonies, so that all things may be done to edification.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>23. The president, the congress, the general assemblies,
the governors, and the councils of state, <hi rend='italic'>as the delegates of
the people</hi>, are the rulers of the United States of America
according to the division of power made to them by the Constitution
of the United States, and by the constitutions of their
respective states. And the said states are a sovereign and
independent nation, and ought not to be subject to any foreign
jurisdiction.</q><note place='foot'><q>As far
as it respects civil affairs, we believe it the duty of Christians,
and especially all Christian ministers, to be subject to the
supreme authority of the country where they may reside, and to use
all laudable means to enjoin obedience to the powers that be; and
therefore it is expected that all our preachers and people, who may
be under the British or any other government, will behave themselves
as peaceable and orderly subjects.</q></note>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>24. The riches and goods of Christians are not common,
as touching the right, title, and possession, of the same, as
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
some do falsely boast. Notwithstanding every man ought, of
such things as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the
poor, according to his ability.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>25. As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden
Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ and James his apostle,
so we judge that the Christian religion doth not prohibit
but that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth, in
a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the
prophet's teaching, in justice, judgment, and truth.</q>

<head> Methodists, Or The Methodist Protestant Church.</head>

<p>
The Protestant Methodists adhere to the Wesleyan Methodist
doctrines, but discard certain parts of the discipline,
particularly those concerning episcopacy and the manner of
constituting the general conference. They seceded from the
<hi rend='italic'>Methodist Episcopal Church</hi> in 1830, and formed a constitution
and discipline of their own.
</p>

<p>
The following preamble and articles precede the constitution:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We, the representatives of the associated Methodist
churches, in general convention assembled, acknowledging
the Lord Jesus Christ as the only HEAD of the church, and
the word of God as the sufficient rule of faith and practice,
in all things pertaining to godliness, and being fully persuaded
that the representative form of church government is the
most scriptural, best suited to our condition, and most congenial
with our views and feelings as fellow-citizens with the
saints, and of the household of God; and whereas, a written
constitution, establishing the form of government, and securing
to the ministers and members of the church their rights
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
and privileges, is the best safeguard of Christian liberty.
We, therefore, trusting in the protection of Almighty God,
and acting in the name and by the authority of our constituents,
do ordain and establish, and agree to be governed by,
the following elementary principles and constitution:&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. A Christian church is a society of believers in Jesus
Christ, and is a divine institution.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. Christ is the only Head of the church, and the word
of God the only rule of faith and conduct.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. No person who loves the Lord Jesus Christ, and
obeys the gospel of God our Savior, ought to be deprived of
church membership.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. Every man has an inalienable right to private judgment
in matters of religion, and an equal right to express
his opinion in any way which will not violate the laws of
God, or the rights of his fellow-men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. Church trials should be conducted on gospel principles
only; and no minister or member should be excommunicated
except for immorality, the propagation of unchristian
doctrines, or for the neglect of duties enjoined by the word
of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. The pastoral or ministerial office and duties are of
divine appointment, and all elders in the church of God are
equal; but ministers are forbidden to be lords over God's
heritage, or to have dominion over the faith of the saints.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. The church has a right to form and enforce such
rules and regulations only as are in accordance with the
holy Scriptures, and may be necessary or have a tendency
to carry into effect the great system of practical Christianity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. Whatever power may be necessary to the formation
of rules and regulations, is inherent in the ministers and
members of the church; but so much of that power may be
delegated, from time to time, upon a plan of representation,
as they may judge necessary and proper.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. It is the duty of all ministers and members of the
church, to maintain godliness, and to oppose all moral evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. It is obligatory on ministers of the gospel to be
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
faithful in the discharge of their pastoral and ministerial
duties, and it is also obligatory on the members to esteem
ministers highly for their works' sake, and to render them a
righteous compensation for their labors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>11. The church ought to secure to all her official bodies
the necessary authority for the purposes of good government;
but she has no right to create any distinct or independent
sovereignties.</q>
</p>

<p>
We omit the constitution, as the preceding elementary
principles sufficiently develop the peculiarities of this
denomination.

<head>Protestants.</head>

<p>
A name first given, in Germany, to those who adhered to
the doctrine of Luther; because, in 1529, they protested
against a decree of the emperor Charles V., and the diet of
Spires, declaring that they appealed to a general council.
The same name has also been given to the Calvinists, and
is now become a common denomination for all sects which
differ from the church of Rome.

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Sabellians.</head>

<p>
A sect, in the third century, that embraced the opinions of
Sabellius, a philosopher of Egypt, who openly taught that
there is but one person in the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
The Sabellians maintained that the Word and the Holy
Spirit are only virtues, emanations, or functions of the Deity,
and held that he who is in heaven is the Father of all things;
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
that he descended into the Virgin, became a child, and was
born of her as a Son; and that, having accomplished the
mystery of our salvation, he diffused himself on the apostles
in tongues of fire, and was then denominated the <hi rend='italic'>Holy Ghost</hi>.
This they explained by resembling God to the sun; the illuminated
virtue or quality of which was the Word, and its
warming virtue the Holy Spirit. The Word, they taught,
was darted, like a divine ray, to accomplish the work of
redemption; and that, being re-ascended to heaven, the influences
of the Father were communicated after a like manner
to the apostles.
</p>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Sandemanians.</head>

<p>
So called from Mr. Robert Sandeman, a Scotchman, who
published his sentiments in 1757. He afterwards came to
America, and established societies at Boston, and other places
in New England, and in Nova Scotia.
</p>

<p>
This sect arose in Scotland about the year 1728, where it
is distinguished at the present day by the name of <hi rend='italic'>Glassites</hi>,
after its founder, Mr. John Glass, a minister of the established
church.
</p>

<p>
The Sandemanians consider that faith is neither more nor
less than a simple assent to the divine testimony concerning
Jesus Christ, delivered for the offences of men, and raised
again for their justification, as recorded in the New Testament,
They also maintain that the word <hi rend='italic'>faith</hi>, or belief, is
constantly used by the apostles to signify what is denoted by
it in common discourse, viz., a persuasion of the truth of any
proposition, and that there is no difference between believing
any common testimony and believing the apostolic testimony,
except that which results from the testimony itself, and the
divine authority on which it rests.
</p>

<p>
They differ from other Christians in their weekly administration
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
of the Lord's supper; their love-feasts, of which every
member is not only allowed, but required, to partake, and
which consist of their dining together at each other's houses
in the interval between the morning and afternoon service;
their kiss of charity, used on this occasion, at the admission
of a new member, and at other times, when they deem it
necessary and proper; their weekly collection, before the
Lord's supper, for the support of the poor, and defraying
other expenses; mutual exhortation; abstinence from blood
and things strangled; washing each other's feet, when, as a
deed of mercy, it might be an expression of love, the precept
concerning which, as well as other precepts, they understand
literally; community of goods, so far as that every one is to
consider all that he has in his possession and power liable to
the calls of the poor and the church; and the unlawfulness
of laying up treasures upon earth, by setting them apart for
any distant, future, or uncertain use. They allow of public
and private diversions, so far as they are not connected with
circumstances really sinful; but, apprehending a lot to be
sacred, disapprove of lotteries, playing at cards, dice, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
They maintain a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, in
each church, and the necessity of the presence of two elders
in every act of discipline, and at the administration of the
Lord's supper.
</p>

<p>
In the choice of these elders, want of learning and engagement
in trade are no sufficient objections, if qualified
according to the instructions given to Timothy and Titus;
but second marriages disqualify for the office; and they are
ordained by prayer and fasting, imposition of hands, and
giving the right hand of fellowship.
</p>

<p>
In their discipline they are strict and severe, and think
themselves obliged to separate from communion and worship
of all such religious societies as appear to them not to profess
the simple truth for their only ground of hope, and who do
not walk in obedience to it. (See John 13:14, 15; 16:13.
Acts 6:7. Rom. 3:27; 4:4, 5; 16:16. 1 Cor. 16:20.
2 Cor. 4:13. 1 Pet. 1:22.)

<head>Antinomians.</head>

<p>
As we elsewhere give the sentiments of the ancient <hi rend='italic'>Bereans</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Pelagians</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>Sabellians</hi>,
it is proper to notice those
of Agricola, an eminent doctor in the Lutheran church, who
flourished about the middle of the sixteenth century. The
word <hi rend='italic'>Antinomian</hi> is derived from two Greek words, signifying
<hi rend='italic'>against law</hi>.
</p>

<p>
It will be observed that the above names are used to denote
sentiments or opinions, rather than sects or denominations.
</p>

<p>
The principal doctrines of the Antinomians, together with
a short specimen of the arguments made use of in their defence,
are comprehended in the following summary:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That the law ought not to be proposed to the people
as a rule of manners, nor used in the church as a means of
instruction; and that the gospel alone is to be inculcated
and explained, both in the churches and in the schools of
learning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For the Scriptures declare that Christ is not the lawgiver;
as it is said, <q>The law was given by Moses; but
grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</q> Therefore the ministers
of the <emph>gospel</emph> ought not to teach the <emph>law</emph>. Christians
are not ruled by the law, but by the spirit of regeneration;
according as it is said, <q>Ye are not under the law, but under
grace.</q> Therefore the law ought not to be taught in the
church of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That the justification of sinners is an immanent and
eternal act of God, not only preceding all acts of sin, but the
existence of the sinner himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For nothing new can arise in God; on which account, he
calls things that are not, as though they were; and the apostle
saith, <q>Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus, before the foundation of
the world.</q> Besides, Christ was set up from everlasting, not
only as the Head of the church, but as the surety of his
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>
people; by virtue of which engagement, the Father decreed
never to impute unto them their sins. (See 2 Cor. 5: 19.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That justification by faith is no more than a manifestation
to us of what was done before we had a being.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For it is thus expressed, in Heb. 11:1: <q>Now, faith is
the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen.</q> We are justified only by Christ; but by faith we
perceive it, and by faith rejoice in it, as we apprehend it to
be our own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That men ought not to doubt of their faith, nor
question whether they believe in Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For we are commanded to <q>draw near in full assurance
of faith.</q> (Heb. 10:22.) <q>He that believeth on the Son of
God, hath the witness in himself,</q> (2 John 5:10;) i. e., he
has as much evidence as can be desired.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That God sees no sin in believers; and they are not
bound to confess sin, mourn for it, or pray that it may be
forgiven.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For God has declared, (Heb. 10:17,) <q>Their sins and
iniquities I will remember no more.</q> And in Jer. 50:20,
<q>In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity
of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will
pardon them whom I reserve.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. That God is not angry with the elect, nor doth he
punish them for their sins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For Christ has made ample satisfaction for their sins. See
Isaiah 53:5, <q>He was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities,</q> &amp;c. And to inflict punishment
once upon the surety, and again upon the believer, is
contrary to the justice of God, as well as derogatory to the
satisfaction of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. That by God's laying our iniquities upon Christ, he
became as completely sinful as we, and we as completely
righteous as Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For Christ represents our persons to the Father; and we
represent the person of Christ to him. The loveliness of
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
Christ is transferred to us. On the other hand, all that is
hateful in our nature is put upon Christ, who was forsaken
by the father for a time. See 2 Cor. 5:21, <q>He was made
sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. That believers need not fear either their own sins
or the sins of others, since neither can do them any injury.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>See Rom. 8:33, 34, <q>Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of God's elect?</q> &amp;c. The apostle does not say that
they never transgress, but triumphs in the thought that no
curse can be executed against them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. That the new covenant is not made properly with us,
but with Christ for us; and that this covenant is all of it a
promise, having no conditions for us to perform; for faith,
repentance, and obedience, are not conditions on our part,
but Christ's; and he repented, believed, and obeyed for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For the covenant is so expressed, that the performance
lies upon the Deity himself. <q>For this is the covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the
Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be
to me a people.</q> Heb. 8:10.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. That sanctification is not a proper evidence of justification.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For those who endeavor to evidence their justification by
their sanctification, are looking to their own attainments, and
not to Christ's righteousness, for hopes of salvation.</q>

<head>Pelagians.</head>

<p>
A denomination which arose in the fifth century, so
called from Pelagius, a monk, who looked upon the doctrines
which were commonly received, concerning the original
corruption of human nature, and the necessity of divine grace
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
to enlighten the understanding and purify the heart, as prejudicial
to the progress of holiness and virtue, and tending to
establish mankind in a presumptuous and fatal security. He
maintained the following doctrines:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That the sins of our first parents were imputed to them
only, and not to their posterity; and that we derive no corruption
from their fall, but are born as pure and unspotted
as Adam came out of the forming hand of his Creator.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That mankind, therefore, are capable of repentance
and amendment, and of arriving to the highest degrees of
piety and virtue, by the use of their natural faculties and
powers. That, indeed, external grace is necessary to excite
their endeavors, but that they have no need of the internal
succors of the divine Spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That Adam was, by nature, mortal, and, whether he
had sinned or not, would certainly have died.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That the grace of God is given in proportion to our
merits.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That mankind may arrive at a state of perfection in
this life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>6. That the law qualified men for the kingdom of heaven,
and was founded upon equal promises with the gospel.</q>
</p>

<head>Pre-Adamites.</head>

<p>
This denomination began about the middle of the sixteenth
century. Their principal tenet is <hi rend='italic'>that there must have been
men before Adam</hi>. One proof of this they bring from Rom.
5:12, 13, 14. The apostle says, <q><hi rend='italic'>Sin was in the world till
the law</hi>;</q> meaning the law given to Adam. But sin, it is
evident, was not imputed, though it might have been committed,
till the time of the pretended first man. <q><hi rend='italic'>For sin is not
imputed when there is no law.</hi></q>
</p>

<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>

<p>
The election of the Jews, they say, is a consequence of the
same system. It began at Adam, who is called their father
or founder. God is also their Father, having espoused the
Judaical church. The Gentiles are only adopted children,
as being Pre-Adamites. Men (or Gentiles) are said to be
made by the word of God. (Gen. 1:26, 27.) Adam, the
founder of the Jewish nation, whose history alone Moses
wrote, is introduced in the second chapter, as the workmanship
of God's own hands, and as created apart from other men.
</p>

<p>
They argue thus:&mdash;Cain, having killed his brother Abel,
was afraid of being killed himself. By whom? He married&mdash;yet
Adam had then no daughter. What wife could he
get? He built a town&mdash;what architects, masons, carpenters,
and workmen, did he employ? The answer to all these
questions is in one word&mdash;Pre-Adamites.
</p>

<p>
This reasoning is opposed by sundry texts of Scripture,
(See Gen. 1:26; 2:7; 3:20. Mark 10:6. I Cor. 15:45, 47.)

<head>Orthodox Creeds.</head>

<p>
Orthodoxy literally signifies <hi rend='italic'>correct opinions</hi>. The word
is generally used to denote those who are attached to the
Trinitarian scheme of Christian doctrine.
</p>

<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>

<p>
The following article is found in the <q>Spirit of the Pilgrims,</q>
vol. v. No. 1, and is supposed to have been written
by the late Rev. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Benjamin B. Wisner</hi>, D. D., pastor of the
Old South church, Boston.
</p>

<p>
The following summary contains the more material parts
of the Orthodox faith. Those who embrace this system
believe,&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That, since the fall of Adam, men are, in their natural
state, altogether destitute of true holiness, and entirely depraved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That men, though thus depraved, are justly required to
love God with all the heart, and justly punishable for disobedience;
or, in other words, they are complete moral agents,
proper subjects of moral government, and truly accountable
to God for their actions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That in the unspeakable wisdom and love of God was
disclosed a plan of redemption for sinful men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That, in the development of this plan, God saw fit to
reveal so much concerning the nature and the mode of the
divine existence, as that he is manifested to his creatures as
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and that these
three, each partaking of all the attributes of the Deity, and
being entitled to receive divine worship and adoration, are
the one living and true God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That the Son of God, laying aside the glory which he
had with the Father from everlasting, came down from
heaven, took upon himself man's nature, and by his humiliation,
sufferings, and death, made an atonement for the sins
of the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That, in consequence of this atonement, the offer of pardon
and eternal life was freely made to all; so that those
who truly repent of sin, and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
will be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That men are naturally so averse to God and holiness,
that, if left to themselves, they reject the offers of salvation,
and neither repent of sin nor truly believe in a Savior.</q>
</p>

<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That God, being moved with infinite love and compassion,
sends forth the Holy Spirit, according to his sovereign
pleasure, by whose beneficent energy an innumerable multitude
of the human family are renewed, sanctified, and prepared
for heaven; while others are suffered to pursue the
course which they have freely chosen, and in which they
obstinately persevere till the day of salvation is past.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That God, in his providential dispensations, in the
bestowment of his saving mercy, and in his universal government,
exhibits his adorable perfections, in such a manner
as will call forth the admiration and love of all holy beings
forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That believers are justified by faith, through the efficacy
of the atonement, so that all claims of human merit, and all
grounds of boasting, are forever excluded.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That the law of God is perpetually binding upon all
moral beings, and upon believers not less than other men, as
a rule of life; and that no repentance is genuine unless it
bring forth fruits meet for repentance, and no faith is saving
unless it produce good works.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That those who have been renewed by the Spirit will be
preserved by the power of God, and advanced in holiness
unto final salvation. And,</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That Christ, as the great King of the universe, the Lord
and Proprietor of created beings, will judge the world at the
last day, when the righteous will be received to life eternal,
and the wicked will be consigned to endless punishment.</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Since the reformation from Popery, those who profess to
admit these doctrines, and others necessarily connected with
them, and forming a part of the same system, have been
denominated Orthodox, while to those who openly reject
them, or any considerable part of them, this appellation has
been denied.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is not to be inferred, however, that the Orthodox have
been, or are, entirely <emph>unanimous</emph> on the subject of religion.
In matters comparatively unessential, and in their modes of
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
stating, explaining, and establishing essential truths, there
has always been more or less a diversity. Thus persons
may disagree as to the form of church government, or as to
the mode of administering ordinances, and yet have an equal
claim to be entitled Orthodox. Or persons may disagree in
their interpretation of particular passages of Scripture, and
as to the manner in which these bear on the doctrines of
religion, without forfeiting their title to the some honorable
appellation. For instance, one person may regard a particular
passage as proof conclusive of the divinity of Christ,
while another may be in doubt respecting it, or may apply it
differently, and yet both be firm believers in the divinity of
Christ. Many passages which the old writers quoted as proof-texts,
have, in the progress of critical science, been differently
interpreted; and yet the evidence in support of the Orthodox
system, so far from being weakened in this way, has been
constantly gaining strength.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Again: persons may disagree, to a certain extent, at least,
in their statements and explanations of the most essential
doctrines, and yet be properly and equally Orthodox. In
illustration of this remark, several examples will be given.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>All Orthodox Christians believe in the full inspiration of
the sacred Scriptures; or that the holy men, through whose
instrumentality the world originally received these Scriptures,
spake and wrote <q>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</q>
They believe in this as a <emph>fact</emph> of the utmost importance.
But there have been various modes of stating, explaining, and
illustrating this fact. Some, for instance, have spoken of
two or three kinds of inspiration; others have insisted that
there can be but one kind; while others have thought it better
to state the subject in general terms, without attempting
very minutely to define or explain them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>All Orthodox Christians believe in the doctrine of the
Trinity, or that the one God exists in a threefold distinction,
commonly called persons,&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. They believe this as a revealed fact, and as an
essential part of the Christian doctrine. But how differently
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
has this fact been stated by different individuals! What
different explanations have been put upon it! While not a
few have preferred to leave the subject&mdash;as God seems to
have left it&mdash;altogether unexplained.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>All Orthodox Christians believe in the universality of God's
eternal purposes, in the certainty of their execution, and that
they are so executed as not to obstruct or impair the free
agency of man. But respecting the <emph>manner</emph> of God's executing
his purposes,&mdash;whether by the instrumentality of motives,
or by a direct efficiency,&mdash;persons having equal claims
to the appellation of Orthodox, have not been agreed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>All the Orthodox believe in the natural and entire depravity
of man; or that, in consequence of the sin of his first progenitors,
and previous to regeneration, every thing within
him, going to constitute moral character, is sinful. But how
many theories have been framed to account for the connection
of our sin with that of Adam! And how many explanations
have been put upon the doctrine of entire depravity!
Some have made this depravity to extend to all the powers
of the soul; others have restricted it to our voluntary exercises
and actions; while others have confined it chiefly to a
moral taste, disposition, or instinct, which is regarded as
back of our voluntary exercises, and the source of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>All the Orthodox believe in the doctrine of atonement;
but all do not state or explain this important doctrine after
the same manner. Some suppose the atonement of Christ to
consist wholly in his obedience, others wholly in his sufferings,
and others in both his obedience and sufferings. Some
hold that Christ suffered the penalty of the law for sinners,
and others that he only opened a way in which, on condition
of repentance, this penalty may be remitted. Some think
the atonement made only for the elect, while others regard it
as the propitiation for the sins of the whole world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The doctrine of instantaneous regeneration by the special
operations of the Holy Spirit, is believed by all who have
any claim to be called Orthodox. But this doctrine, like the
others mentioned, is variously stated and explained. Some
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>
consider man as entirely active in regeneration, others as
entirely passive, and others as not entirely the one or the
other. Some believe there is a holy principle implanted in
regeneration, which ever afterwards remains in the heart of
the subject, while others believe the change to consist in the
commencement of holy exercises, which may be subsequently
interrupted, though not finally lost. As to the manner in
which the Spirit operates in regeneration, there is also a
difference of opinion; some holding that he changes the
heart by a direct efficiency, and others that this is done by
the more powerful presentation and impression of motives.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Another doctrine of the Orthodox system is, that of justification
by faith in Christ. But this, also, has been differently
stated and explained. Some think the believer justified
by Christ's righteousness, others by the influence of his sufferings
and death, and others by the joint efficacy of both his
obedience and sufferings. Some believe justification to be
the same as forgiveness, while others regard it as implying,
not only forgiveness, but also a title to eternal life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is evident, from the examples here given, that, although
Orthodoxy denotes a general system of important doctrines
or facts on the subject of religion, it is not to be inferred,
either by friends or foes, that Orthodox Christians are tied
up to precisely the same views of subjects, or that there
exists no diversity of sentiment among them. There is, and
always has been, a diversity of sentiment, in regard not only
to modes and forms, but to the statement, proofs, and explanations,
of the most important doctrines. Some of them, to
be sure, are little more than verbal; but others are <emph>real</emph>, are
fitted to excite interest, and are entitled to very serious consideration.
Still, as they are all held in avowed consistency
with that great series of facts which go to constitute the
Orthodox system, they should not be regarded as placing
their advocates beyond the proper limits of Orthodoxy. They
constitute a wide field of important discussion, over which
those who agree in holding the Head,&mdash;in holding the great
doctrines of redemption by the blood of Christ, and of sanctification
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>
by the Holy Spirit,&mdash;may freely and fraternally
traverse. Modes and forms, the interpretation of passages,
and explanations of particular doctrines, (so long as essential
doctrines are not discarded,) may be discussed without the
interruption of brotherly affection, and without the imputation
and reproach of heresy. One person may hold that all
Scripture is given by the inspiration of <emph>suggestion</emph>; and
another that, while some parts are the fruit of immediate
suggestion, others may more properly be attributed to the
inspiration of <emph>superintendence</emph>; and neither should charge
the other with denying the inspiration of the Scriptures, or
with being a heretic, or an infidel. One person may insist
that the passage in 1 John 5:7, is authentic Scripture, and
strong proof of the doctrine of the Trinity; and another may
doubt this, or deny it altogether; and neither should be
charged with intentionally corrupting the Scriptures, or with
being a Unitarian. One person may hold that God executes
his immutable and eternal decrees by a direct efficiency, and
another that he does it by the intervention of motives, and
yet one be no more an Arminian than the other.</q>

see the kingdom of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>; that
<hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>, of his mere good
pleasure, from all eternity, elected some to everlasting life,
and that he entered into a covenant of grace, to deliver them
out of this state of sin and misery by a <hi rend='smallcaps'>Redeemer</hi>; that the
only <hi rend='smallcaps'>Redeemer</hi> of the elect is
the eternal <hi rend='smallcaps'>Son</hi> of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>, who,
for this purpose, became man, and continues to be <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> and
man, in two distinct natures, and one person, forever; that
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi>, as our Redeemer, executeth the office of a Prophet,
Priest, and King; that, agreeably to the covenant of redemption,
the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Son</hi> of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>,
and he alone, by his sufferings
and death, has made atonement for the sins of all men; that
repentance, faith, and holiness, are the personal requisites in
the gospel scheme of salvation; that the righteousness of
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi> is the only ground of a sinner's justification; that
this righteousness is received through faith; and that this
faith is the gift of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>; so that our salvation is wholly of
grace; that no means whatever can change the heart of a
sinner, and make it holy; that regeneration and sanctification
are effects of the creating and renewing agency of the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Holy
Spirit</hi>, and that supreme love to
<hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> constitutes the essential
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>
difference between saints and sinners; that, by convincing
us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds,
working faith in us, and renewing our wills, the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Holy Spirit</hi>
makes us partakers of the benefits of redemption; and that
the ordinary means by which these benefits are communicated
to us, are the word, sacraments, and prayer; that repentance
unto life, faith to feed upon <hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi>,
love to <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>, and new
obedience, are the appropriate qualifications for the Lord's
supper; and that a Christian church ought to admit no person
to its holy communion, before he exhibit credible evidence
of his godly sincerity; that perseverance in holiness is
the only method of making our calling and election sure,
and that the final perseverance of saints, though it is the effect
of the special operation of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> on their hearts, necessarily
implies their own watchful diligence; that they who
are effectually called, do, in this life, partake of justification,
adoption, and sanctification, and the several benefits which
do either accompany or flow from them; that the souls of
believers are, at their death, made perfect in holiness, and do
immediately pass into glory; that their bodies, being still
united to <hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi>, will, at the resurrection, be raised up to
glory, and that the saints will be made perfectly blessed in the
full enjoyment of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>, to all eternity: but that the wicked
will awake to shame and everlasting contempt, and, with
devils, be plunged into the lake that burneth with fire and
brimstone forever and ever. I moreover believe that
<hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>, according
to the counsel of his own will, and for his own glory,
hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, and that all
beings, actions, and events, both in the natural and moral
world, are under his providential direction; that <hi rend='smallcaps'>God's</hi> decrees
perfectly consist with human liberty, <hi rend='smallcaps'>God's</hi> universal
agency with the agency of man, and man's dependence with
his accountability; that man has understanding and corporeal
strength to do all that <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> requires of him; so that nothing
but the sinner's aversion to holiness prevents his salvation;
that it is the prerogative of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> to bring good out of evil,
and that he will cause the wrath and rage of wicked men
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
and devils to praise him; and that all the evil which has existed,
and will forever exist, in the moral system, will eventually
be made to promote a most important purpose, under the
wise and perfect administration of that <hi rend='smallcaps'>Almighty Being</hi>,
who will cause all things to work for his own glory, and thus
fulfil all his pleasure.</q>

Considerable anxiety existed, a few years since, in regard
to the Orthodoxy of the Rev. Dr. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Taylor</hi>, professor of divinity
at Yale College, at New Haven, in the state of Connecticut.
The following letter from Dr. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Taylor</hi> to the
Rev. Dr. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Hawes</hi>, of Hartford, contains a full exposition of
the religious views of that distinguished theologian:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Yale College</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Feb. 1, 1832.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Dear Brother:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I thank you for yours of the 23d ult., in which
you express your approbation of my preaching during the
protracted meetings at Hartford. This expression of fraternal
confidence is grateful to me, not because I ever supposed
that we differed in our views of the great doctrines of the
gospel, but because, for some reason or other, an impression
has been made, to some extent, <hi rend='italic'>that I am unsound in the
faith</hi>. This impression, I feel bound to say, in my own view,
is wholly groundless and unauthorized. You think, however,
that <q>I owe it to myself, to the institution with which I am
connected, and to the Christian community, to make a frank
and full statement of my views of some of the leading doctrines
of the gospel, and that this cannot fail to relieve the
minds of many, who are now suspicious of my Orthodoxy.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here I must be permitted to say, that the repeated and
full statements of my opinions, which I have already made to
the public, would seem to be sufficient to prevent or remove
such suspicions. The course you propose, however, may
furnish information to some who would desire it before they
form an opinion, as well as the means of correcting the
misrepresentations of others. I therefore readily comply
with your request, and submit to your disposal the following
statement of my belief on some of the leading doctrines of
the gospel. I believe,&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That there are three persons in one God,&mdash;the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</q>
</p>

<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That the eternal purposes of God extend to all actual
events, sin not excepted; or that God foreordains whatsoever
comes to pass, and so executes these purposes, as to leave the
free moral agency of man unimpaired.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That all mankind, in consequence of the fall of
Adam, are born destitute of holiness, and are by nature
totally depraved; in other words, that all men, from the
commencement of moral agency, do, without the interposition
of divine grace, sin, and only sin, in all their moral
conduct.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That an atonement for sin has been made for all
mankind by the Lord Jesus Christ; that this atonement was
necessary to magnify the law, and to vindicate and unfold
the justice of God in the pardon of sin; and that the sinner
who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ is freely justified
on the ground of his atoning sacrifice, and on that ground
alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That the change in regeneration is a <emph>moral</emph> change,
consisting in a new, holy disposition, or governing purpose
of the heart, as a permanent principle of action; in which
change, the sinner transfers the <emph>supreme</emph> affection of his
heart from all inferior objects to the living God, chooses him
as the portion of his soul, and his service and glory as his
supreme good, and thus, in respect to moral character,
becomes a <emph>new man</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. That this moral change is never produced in the
human heart by <emph>moral suasion</emph>, i. e., by the mere influence of
truth and motives, as the Pelagians affirm, but is produced
by the influence of the Holy Spirit, operating on the mind
through the truth, and in perfect consistency with the nature
of moral action, and laws of moral agency.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. That all men (in the words of the article of your
church) may accept of the offers of salvation freely made to
them in the gospel, but that no one will do this, except he be
drawn by the Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. That the necessity of the influence of the Holy Spirit
in regeneration results solely from the voluntary perverseness
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
of the sinner's heart, or disinclination to serve God, which,
while it leaves him a complete moral agent, and without excuse
for neglecting his duty, suspends his actual salvation on the
sovereign will of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. That the renewing grace of God is <emph>special</emph>, in distinction
from that which is common, and is resisted by the
sinful mind, inasmuch as it is that which is designed to
secure, and does infallibly secure, the conversion of the
sinner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. That all who are renewed by the Holy Spirit are
elected or chosen of God from eternity, that they should be
holy, not on account of foreseen faith, or good works, but
according to the good pleasure of his will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>11. That all who are renewed by the Holy Spirit, will,
through his continual influence, persevere in holiness to the
end, and obtain eternal life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Such is my faith in respect to some of the lending doctrines
of the gospel. These doctrines I preach; these I
teach in the theological department of this Seminary; these
I have repeatedly published to the world. With what truth
or justice any regard me as a <q>teacher of theology, introducing
heresy into our churches,</q> the candid can judge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But it may be asked, whether, after all, there are not
some points on which I differ from my brethren generally,
or, at least, from some of them. I answer,&mdash;It would be
strange if any two man should be found to agree exactly in
all the minute matters of religious opinion. With respect,
however, to what is properly considered the Orthodox or
Calvinistic <hi rend='smallcaps'>system</hi> of
doctrines, as including the great <hi rend='smallcaps'>facts</hi>
of Christianity, and as opposed to, and distinguished from, the
Unitarian, Pelagian, and Arminian <emph>systems</emph>, I suppose there is
between the Orthodox ministry and myself an entire agreement.
In respect to comparatively minor points, and philosophical
theories, and modes of defending the Calvinistic system of
doctrines, there has always been, as you are aware, a diversity
of opinion, with freedom of discussion, among the Calvinists
in this country, especially in New England, but which
<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>
has never impaired their fellowship or mutual confidence.
To these topics of difference, greater or less importance has
been attached by different individuals. In respect to some
of these, (and, in respect to them, I suppose myself to agree
with a large majority of our Calvinistic clergy,) I will now
briefly but frankly state what I do <emph>not</emph>, and what I do, believe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that the posterity of Adam are, in the
proper sense of the language, guilty of his sin; or that the ill
desert of that sin is truly theirs; or that they are punished
for that sin. But I do believe that, by the wise and holy
constitution of God, all mankind, in consequence of Adam's
sin, become sinners by their own act.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that the nature of the human mind,
which God creates, is itself sinful; or that God punishes men
for the nature which he creates; or that sin pertains to any
thing in the mind which precedes all conscious mental exercise
or action, and which is neither a matter of consciousness
nor of knowledge. But I do believe that sin, universally, is
no other than selfishness, or a <emph>preference</emph> of one's self to all
others,&mdash;of some inferior good to God; that this free, voluntary
preference is a permanent principle of action in all the
unconverted; and that this is sin, and all that in the Scriptures
is meant by sin. I also believe that such is the <emph>nature</emph>
of the human mind, that it becomes the occasion of universal
sin in men in all the appropriate circumstances of their
existence, and that, therefore, they are truly and properly
said to be sinners <emph>by nature</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that sin can be proved to be the necessary
means of the greatest good, and that, as such, God prefers
it, on the whole, to holiness in its stead; or that a God of
sincerity and truth punishes his creatures for doing that
which he, on the whole, prefers they should do, and which, as
the means of good, is the best thing they can do. But I do
believe that holiness, as the means of good, may be better
than sin; that it may be true that God, all things considered,
prefers holiness to sin in all instances in which the latter
takes place, and, therefore, sincerely desires that all men
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
should come to repentance, though, for wise and good reasons,
he <emph>permits</emph>, or does not prevent, the existence of sin. I
do <emph>not</emph> believe that it can be proved that an omnipotent God
would be <emph>unable</emph> to secure more good by means of the perfect
and universal obedience of his creatures, if they would render
it, than by means of their sin. But I do believe that it may
involve a dishonorable limitation of his power to suppose that
he could not do it.</q><note place='foot'><q>The question
is, not whether God, all things considered, has purposed
the existence of sin rather than to prevent it; but for what <emph>reason</emph>
has he purposed it? Some affirm this <emph>reason</emph> to be, <emph>that sin is the
necessary means of the greatest good</emph>. Now, what I claim, and all that I claim,
is, that <emph>no one can prove this to be the reason</emph> why God has purposed the
existence of sin, and that some other may be <emph>the true reason</emph>, without
affirming what the true reason is.</q></note>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that the grace of God can be truly said
to be <emph>irresistible</emph>, in the primary, proper import of this term.
But I do believe that, in all cases, it <emph>may be</emph> resisted by man
as a free moral agent, and that, when it becomes effectual to
conversion, as it infallibly does in the case of all the elect, it
is <emph>unresisted</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that the grace of God is necessary, as
Arminians and some others maintain, to render man an accountable
agent, and responsible for rejecting the offers of
eternal life. But I do believe that man would be such an
agent, and thus responsible, were no such grace afforded, and
that otherwise <q>grace would be no more grace.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that it is necessary that the sinner, in
using the means of regeneration, should commit sin in order
to become holy. But I do believe that, as a moral agent, he
is qualified so to use these means, i. e., the truth of God when
present to his mind, as to become holy at once; that he is
authorized to believe that, through the grace of the Holy
Spirit, this <emph>may be</emph> done; and that, except in so doing, he
cannot be truly and properly said to <emph>use</emph> the means of regeneration.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I do <emph>not</emph> believe that we are authorized to assure the sinner,
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
as Arminians do, and some others also, that the Holy
Spirit is always ready to convert him. But I do believe
that we are authorized to assure any sinner that it <emph>may be
true</emph> that the Holy Spirit is now ready to convert him;
<q>that God <hi rend='smallcaps'>peradventure</hi> will now give him repentance;</q>
and that thus, in view of the possible intervention of divine
influence, we remove what would otherwise be a ground of
fatal discouragement to the sinner, when we exhort him to
immediate repentance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I have dwelt the more on some of these particulars, because
much pains has been taken, by some individuals, to
make the impression that I have departed from the true
faith respecting the influences of the Holy Spirit, even denying
his influences altogether. So far is this from the fact,
that, as you well know, no one attaches higher importance to
this doctrine than I do, preaches it more decisively, or appreciates
more highly its practical relations and bearings.
In my own view, the power of the gospel on the mind of the
sinner very much consists in the two great facts of his complete
moral agency as the basis of his obligation, of his guilt,
and of his duty;&mdash;and of his dependence on the sovereign
grace of God, resulting from his voluntary perverseness in
sin. Without the latter, we could, in my opinion, neither
show the Christian what thanks he owes his Deliverer from
sin, nor awaken the sinner to flee from the wrath to come.
This doctrine seems to be indispensable to destroy the presumptuous
reliance of the sinner on future repentance, as it
shows him how fearfully he provokes an offended God to
withhold the grace on which all depends. At the same time,
one thing is indubitably certain, viz., that God never revealed
the doctrine of the sinner's dependence on his Spirit, to present
the sinner from doing his duty at once. God does not
call sinners to instant compliance with the terms of life, and
then assure them that such compliance is utterly out of the
question, and to be wholly despaired of. The opposite impression,
however, is not uncommon; and it is an error not
less fatal to immediate repentance, than the fond hope of
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
repenting hereafter. Both are to be destroyed; and he who
does not preach the gospel in that manner which tends to
destroy both, preaches it but imperfectly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In the earlier revivals of this country, great prominence
was given, in the preaching, to the doctrine of dependence,
in the forms of regeneration, election, &amp;c. This was what
was to be expected from the Calvinistic preachers of the
time, in view of the prevalence of Arminianism. In the
more recent revivals, however, a similar prominence seems to
be given to moral agency, in the forms of present obligation
to duty, its present practicability, &amp;c. The preaching,
thus distinguished in its more prominent characteristics, has
been undeniably owned and blessed by the Spirit of God,
although we are very apt to believe that what is true of one
kind of preaching at one time, must be true of it at another.
Now, I believe that both the doctrines of dependence and
moral accountability must be <emph>admitted by the public mind</emph>, to
secure upon that mind the full power of the gospel. I also
believe that greater or less <emph>prominence</emph> should be given to
the one or the other of these doctrines, according to the prevailing
state of public opinion. When, at the earlier periods
alluded to, the doctrine of dependence was dwelt on chiefly,
(I do not suppose exclusively,) the public mind believed
enough&mdash;I might say too much&mdash;concerning the free moral
agency of man, and had not so well learned as since to pervert
the doctrine of dependence to justify the waiting attitude
of a passive recipient. And, then, both doctrines told
with power on the mind and the conscience, and, through
God, were attended with great and happy results. But the
prominence given to the doctrine of dependence, in preaching,
was continued, until, if I mistake not, it so engrossed the
public attention, and so obscured or weakened the doctrine of
responsibility, that many fell into the opposite error of quietly
waiting for God's interposition. Hence, when this prevailing
error is again corrected by a more prominent exhibition
of man's responsibility, in the form of immediate obligation,
&amp;c., the power of both doctrines is again combined on
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
the public mind, and we see the same or even greater results
in revivals of religion. Nor would it be strange if the latter
kind of preaching should, in its turn, prevail so exclusively and
so long, that the practical influence of the doctrine of dependence
should be greatly impaired, to be followed with another
dearth of revivals and a quiet reliance of sinful men on their
own self-sufficiency. On this subject, I have often, in view
of the tendency of the human mind to vacillate from one
extreme to the other, expressed my apprehensions. In some
of my brethren, whom I love and respect, I see what I esteem
a <emph>disproportioned</emph> estimate of the importance of preaching
dependence; in others, whom I equally respect, I see what I
regard as a <emph>disproportioned</emph> estimate of the importance of
preaching moral responsibility. In regard to myself, I can
say that I have aimed, in this respect, rightly to divide the
word of truth, and that those discourses in which I have best
succeeded in bringing the two doctrines to bear, in their combined
force, on the mind, have been more blessed to the
awakening and conversion of sinners, than almost any others
which I preach. When both doctrines are wisely and truly
presented, the sinner has no resting-place. Ho cannot well
avoid a sense of guilt while proposing to remain in his sins,
for he sees that he is a free moral agent, under all the responsibilities
of such an agent to immediate duty. He cannot
well presume on his resolution of future repentance, for he
sees that sovereign, injured grace may at once abandon him
to hopeless sin. He is thus shut up to the faith,&mdash;to the immediate
performance of his duty. In accordance with these
views, I aim, in my instructions to those who are preparing
for the ministry, to inculcate the importance of a consistent,
well-proportioned exhibition of the two great doctrines of the
sinner's dependence and responsibility, that, in this respect,
they may hold the minds of their hearers under the full influence
of that gospel which is the power of God to salvation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have thus stated, more minutely, perhaps, than you anticipated,
my views and opinions. I could wish that they
might be satisfactory to all our Orthodox brethren. I have
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
no doubt that they will be to very many, and to some who
have been alarmed by groundless rumors concerning my unsoundness
in the faith. With respect to what I have called
<emph>leading doctrines</emph>, I regard these as among the cardinal truths
of the Christian system. They are truths to which I attach
the highest importance, and in which my faith is more and
more confirmed, the more I examine the word of God. To
<emph>some</emph> of those of which I have spoken as <emph>comparatively minor
points</emph>, I attach a high importance in their practical bearings
and doctrinal connections. They are points, however, in regard
to which there is more or less diversity of opinion
among the Orthodox; and, as it is not my intention nor my
practice to denounce others as heretics, merely because they
differ from me in these matters, so I should be pleased with
the reciprocation of the like catholicism on their part.</q>

<head>Swedenborgians, Or, The New Jerusalem Church.</head>

<p>
Emanuel Swedenborg, the father of this sect, was the
son of a bishop of West Gothnia, in the kingdom of Sweden,
whose name was Swedberg, a man of considerable learning
and celebrity in his time. The son was born at Stockholm,
January 29, 1688, and died in London, 1772. He enjoyed
early the advantages of a liberal education, and, being naturally
endowed with uncommon talents for the acquirement of
learning, his progress in the sciences was rapid and extensive,
and he soon distinguished himself by several publications
in the Latin language, which gave proof of equal genius
and erudition. It may reasonably be supposed that, under
the care of his pious and reverend father, our author's religious
instruction was not neglected. This, indeed, appears
plain from the general tenor of his life and writings, which
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>
are marked with strong and lively characters of a mind
deeply impressed with a sense of the divine Being, and of all
the relative duties thence resulting. He was ennobled in
the year 1719, by Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and named Swedenborg,
from which time he took his seat with the nobles of
the equestrian order, in the triennial assembly of the states.
</p>

<p>
Baron Swedenborg had many eccentricities; but perhaps
the most remarkable circumstance respecting him was his
asserting that, during the uninterrupted period of twenty-seven
years, he enjoyed open intercourse with the world of
departed spirits, and during that time was instructed in the
internal sense of the sacred Scriptures, hitherto undiscovered.

<q rend='pre'>2. That <hi rend='smallcaps'>Jehovah God</hi>
himself descended from heaven,
as Divine Truth, which is the Word, and took upon him
Human Nature for the purpose of removing from man the
powers of hell, and restoring to order all things in the spiritual
world, and all things in the church: That he removed
from man the powers of hell, by combats against and victories
over them; in which consisted the great work of Redemption:
That by the same acts, which were his temptations,
the last of which was the passion of the cross, he united, in
his Humanity, Divine Truth to Divine Good, or Divine
Wisdom to Divine Love, and so returned into his Divinity in
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
which he was from eternity, together with, and in, his Glorified
Humanity; whence he forever keeps the infernal powers
in subjection to himself: And that all who believe in him,
with the understanding, from the heart, and live accordingly,
will be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That the Sacred Scripture, or Word of GOD, is
Divine Truth itself; containing a Spiritual Sense heretofore
unknown, whence it is divinely inspired, and holy in every
syllable; as well as a Literal Sense, which is the basis of its
Spiritual Sense, and in which Divine Truth is in its fulness,
its sanctity, and its power; thus that it is accommodated to
the apprehension both of angels and men: That the spiritual
and natural senses are united, by correspondences,
like soul and body, every natural expression and image
answering to, and including, a spiritual and divine idea:
And thus that the Word is the medium of communication
with heaven, and of conjunction with the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That the government of the Lord's Divine Love and
Wisdom is the Divine Providence; which is universal, exercised
according to certain fixed laws of Order, and extending
to the minutest particulars of the life of all men, both of the
good and of the evil: That in all its operations it has respect
to what is infinite and eternal, and makes no account of
things transitory, but as they are subservient to eternal ends;
thus that it mainly consists, with man, in the connection of
things temporal with things eternal; for that the continual
aim of the Lord, by his Divine Providence, is to join man to
himself and himself to man, that he may be able to give him
the felicities of eternal life: And that the laws of permission
are also laws of the Divine Providence; since evil cannot be
prevented without destroying the nature of man as an accountable
agent; and because, also, it cannot be removed
unless it be known, and cannot be known unless it appear.
Thus that no evil is permitted but to prevent a greater; and
all is overruled, by the Lord's Divine Providence, for the
greatest possible good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That man is not life, but is only a recipient of life
<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>
from the Lord, who, as he is Love Itself and Wisdom Itself,
is also Life Itself; which life is communicated by influx to
all in the spiritual world, whether belonging to heaven or to
hell, and to all in the natural world; but is received differently
by every one, according to his quality and consequent
state of reception.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. That man, during his abode in the world, is, as to his
spirit, in the midst between heaven and hell, acted upon by
influences from both, and thus is kept in a state of spiritual
equilibrium between good and evil; in consequence of which
he enjoys free will, or freedom of choice, in spiritual things
as well as in natural, and possesses the capacity of either
turning himself to the Lord and his kingdom, or turning
himself away from the Lord, and connecting himself with
the kingdom of darkness: And that, unless man had such
freedom of choice, the Word would be of no use, the church
would be a mere name, man would possess nothing by virtue
of which he could be conjoined to the Lord, and the cause
of evil would be chargeable on GOD himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. That man at this day is born into evil of all kinds, or
with tendencies towards it: That, therefore, in order to his
entering the kingdom of heaven, he must be regenerated, or
created anew; which great work is effected in a progressive
manner, by the Lord alone, by charity and faith as mediums,
during man's coöperation: That, as all men are redeemed,
all are capable of being regenerated, and, consequently saved,
every one according to his state: And that the regenerate
man is in communion with the angels of heaven, and the unregenerate
with the spirits of hell: But that no one is condemned
for hereditary evil, any further than as he makes it
his own by actual life; whence all who die in infancy are
saved, special means being provided by the Lord in the other
life for that purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. That Repentance is the first beginning of the Church
in man; and that it consists in a man's examining himself,
both in regard to his deeds and his intentions, in knowing
and acknowledging his sins, confessing them before the Lord,
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
supplicating him for aid, and beginning a new life: That, to
this end, all evils, whether of affection, of thought, or of life,
are to be abhorred and shunned as sins against GOD, and
because they proceed from infernal spirits, who in the aggregate
are called the Devil and Satan; and that good affections,
good thoughts, and good actions, are to be cherished and
performed, because they are of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>
and from <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>: That
these things are to be done by man as of himself; nevertheless,
under the acknowledgment and belief, that it is from
the Lord, operating in him and by him: That so far as man
shuns evils as sins, so far they are removed, remitted, or forgiven;
so far also he does good, not from himself, but from
the Lord; and in the same degree he loves truth, has faith,
and is a spiritual man: And that the Decalogue teaches
what evils are sins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. That Charity, Faith, and Good Works, are unitedly
necessary to man's salvation; since charity, without faith, is
not spiritual, but natural; and faith, without charity, is not
living, but dead; and both charity and faith, without good
works, are merely mental and perishable things, because
without use or fixedness: And that nothing of faith, of
charity, or of good works, is of man; but that all is of the
Lord, and all the merit is his alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. That Baptism and the Holy Supper are sacraments
of divine institution, and are to be permanently observed;
Baptism being an external medium of introduction into the
Church, and a sign representative of man's purification and
regeneration; and the Holy Supper being an external medium
to those who receive it worthily, of introduction, as to
spirit, into heaven, and of conjunction with the Lord; of
which also it is a sign and seal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>11. That, immediately after death, which is only a putting
off of the material body, never to be resumed, man rises
again in a spiritual or substantial body, in which he continues
to live to eternity; in heaven, if his ruling affections, and
hence his life, have been good; and in hell, if his ruling
affections, and thence his life, have been evil.</q>
</p>

<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>

<p>
<q>12. That Now is the time of the Second Advent of the
Lord which is a Coming, not in Person, but in the power
and glory of his Holy Word: That it is attended, like his
first Coming, with the restoration to order of all things in the
spiritual world, where the wonderful divine operation, commonly
expected under the name of the Last Judgment, has
in consequence been performed; and with the preparing of
the way for a New Church on the earth,&mdash;the first Christian
Church having spiritually come to its end or consummation,
through evils of life and errors of doctrine, as foretold by the
Lord in the Gospels: And that this New or Second Christian
Church, which will be the Crown of all Churches,
and will stand forever, is what was representatively seen by
John, when he beheld the holy city, New Jerusalem, descending
from <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi> out of heaven, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband.</q>

The leading theological works of Swedenborg are, the
<hi rend='italic'>Heavenly Arcana</hi>, in twelve octavo volumes, giving an
explanation of the books of Genesis and Exodus, being a
key to what he calls the internal or spiritual sense of the
sacred Scriptures. The next in importance is the <hi rend='italic'>Apocalypse
Explained</hi>, in six octavo volumes, containing a full
explanation of that book.
</p>

<p>
From his last work, <hi rend='italic'>The True Christian Religion</hi>, we
make the following extracts, to show some of his peculiar
views and style of writing:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Concerning the Spiritual World.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The spiritual world has been treated of in a particular
work concerning <hi rend='smallcaps'>Heaven and Hell</hi>, in which many things
of that world are described; and, because every man, after
death, comes into that world, the state of men there is also
described. Who does not know, or may not know, that man
lives after death? both because he is born a man, created an
image of God, and because the Lord teaches it in his word.
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
But what life he is to live, has been hitherto unknown. It
has been believed that then he would be a soul, of which
they entertained no other idea than as of ether, or air; thus
that it is breath, or spirit, such as man breathes out of his
mouth when he dies, in which, nevertheless, his vitality resides;
but that it is without sight, such as is of the eye, without
hearing, such as is of the ear, and without speech, such
as is of the mouth; when yet, man, after death, is equally a
man, and such a man, that he does not know but that he is
still in the former world. He walks, runs, and sits, as in the
former world; he lies down, sleeps, and wakes up, as in the
former world; he eats and drinks, as in the former world;
he enjoys conjugial delight, as in the former world; in a
word, he is a man as to all and every particular; whence it
is manifest, that death is not an extinction, but a continuation,
of life, and that it is only a transition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That man is equally a man after death, although he does
not then appear to the eyes of the material body, may be evident
from the angels seen by Abraham, Hagar, Gideon,
Daniel, and some of the prophets,&mdash;from the angels seen in
the Lord's sepulchre, and afterwards, many times, by John,
concerning whom in the Revelation,&mdash;and especially from
the Lord himself, who showed that he was a man by the touch
and by eating, and yet he became invisible to their eyes.
Who can be so delirious, as not to acknowledge that, although
he was invisible, he was still equally a man? The
reason why they saw him was, because then the eyes of their
spirit were opened; and, when these are opened, the things
which are in the spiritual world appear as clearly as those
which are in the natural world. The difference between a
man in the natural world and a man in the spiritual world is,
that the latter is clothed with a substantial body, but the
former with a material body, in which, inwardly, is his substantial
body; and a substantial man sees a substantial man
as clearly as a material man sees a material man; but a substantial
man cannot see a material man, nor a material man
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
a substantial man, on account of the difference between material
and substantial, which is such as may be described, but
not in a few words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>From the things seen for so many years, I can relate the
following: That there are lands in the spiritual world, as
well as in the natural world, and that there are also plains,
and valleys, and mountains, and hills, and likewise fountains
and rivers; that there are paradises, gardens, groves, and
woods; that there are cities, and in them palaces and houses;
and also that there are writings and books; that there are
employments and tradings; and that there are gold, silver,
and precious stones; in a word, that there are all things
whatsoever that are in the natural world; but those in heaven
are immensely more perfect. But the difference is, that all
things that are seen in the spiritual world are created in a
moment by the Lord, as houses, paradises, food, and other
things; and that they are created for correspondence with
the interiors of the angels and spirits, which are their affections
and thoughts thence; but that all things that are seen
in the natural world exist and grow from seed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Since it is so, and I have daily spoken there with the
nations and people of this world,&mdash;thus not only with those
who are in Europe, but also with those who are in Asia and
in Africa, thus with those who are of various religions,&mdash;I
shall add, as a conclusion to this work, a short description
of the state of some of them. It is to be observed, that the
state of every nation and people in general, as well as of each
individual in particular, in the spiritual world, is according
to the acknowledgment of God, and the worship of him;
and that all who in heart acknowledge a God, and, after this
time, those who acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ to be
God, the Redeemer and Savior, are in heaven; and that
those who do not acknowledge him are under heaven, and
are there instructed; and that those who receive are raised
up into heaven, and that those who do not receive are cast
down into hell.</q>
</p>

<p>
Swedenborg says, <q rend='pre'>The Dutch are easily distinguished
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
from others in the spiritual world, because they appear in
garments like those which they wore in the natural world;
with the distinction, that those appear in finer ones, who have
received faith and spiritual life. The reason why they are
clothed in the like garments is, because they remain constantly
in the principles of their religion; and all in the spiritual
world are clothed according to them; wherefore, those
there who are in divine truths, have white garments, and of
fine linen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The cities in which the Dutch live are guarded in a singular
manner: all the streets in them are covered with roofs,
and there are gates in the streets, so that they may not be
seen from the rocks and hills round about: this is done on
account of their inherent prudence in concealing their designs,
and not divulging their intentions; for such things, in
the spiritual world, are drawn forth by inspection. When
any one comes for the purpose of exploring their state, and
is about to go out, he is led to the gates of the streets, which
are shut, and thus is led back, and led to others, and this
even to the highest degree of vexation, and then he is let out;
this is done that he may not return. Wives, who affect dominion
over their husbands, live at one side of the city, and
do not meet their husbands, except when they are invited,
which is done in a civil manner; and then they also lead
them to houses, where consorts live without exercising dominion
over each other, and show them how clean and elegant
their houses are, and what enjoyment of life they have,
and that they have these things from mutual and conjugal
love. Those wives who attend to these things, and are affected
by them, cease to exercise dominion, and live together
with their husbands; and then they have a habitation assigned
to them nearer to the middle, and are called angels: the reason
is, because truly conjugal love is heavenly love, which is
without dominion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With respect to the English nation, the best of them are in
the centre of all Christians, because they have interior intellectual
light. This does not appear to any one in the natural
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>
world, but it appears conspicuously in the spiritual world.
This light they derive from the liberty of speaking and
writing, and thereby of thinking. With others, who are not
in such liberty, that light, not having any outlet, is obstructed.
That light, indeed, is not active of itself, but it is made active
by others, especially by men of reputation and authority.
As soon as any thing is said by them, that light shines forth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For this reason, they have moderators appointed over them
in the spiritual world; and priests are given to them, of high
reputation and eminent talents, in whose opinions, from this
their natural disposition, they acquiesce.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There are two great cities, like London, into which most
of the English come after death: it has been given me to see
the former city, and also to walk over it. The middle of that
city is where the merchants meet in London, which is called
the Exchange: there the moderators dwell. Above that
middle is the east, below it is the west, on the right side is
the south, on the left side is the north. In the eastern quarter,
those dwell who have preëminently led a life of charity:
there are magnificent palaces. In the southern quarter the
wise dwell, with whom there are many splendid things. In
the northern quarter, those dwell who have preëminently
loved the liberty of speaking and writing. In the western
quarter, those dwell who boast of justification by faith atone.
On the right there, in this quarter, is the entrance into this
city, and also a way out of it: those who live ill are sent out
there. The ministers who are in the west, and teach that
faith alone, dare not enter the city through the great streets,
but through narrow alleys; since no other inhabitants are
tolerated in the city itself, than those who are in the faith of
charity. I have heard them complaining of the preachers
from the west, that they compose their sermons with such
art and eloquence, and introduce into them the strange doctrine
of justification by faith, that they do not know whether
good ought to be done or not. They preach faith as intrinsic
good, and separate this from the good of charity, which they
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
call meritorious, and thus not acceptable to God. But, when
those who dwell in the eastern and southern quarters of the
city hear such sermons, they go out of the temples; and the
preachers afterwards are deprived of the priestly office.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Concerning the Popish Saints in the Spiritual World.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is known that man has innate or hereditary evil from
parents; but it is known to few in what that dwells, in its
fulness: it dwells in the love of possessing the goods of all
others, and in the love of ruling; for this latter love is such,
that, as far as the reins are given to it, so far it bursts forth,
until it burns with the desire of ruling over all, and, at length,
wishes to be invoked and worshipped as a god. This love is
the serpent, which deceived Eve and Adam; for it said to
the woman, <hi rend='italic'>God doth know, in the day that ye eat of the
fruit of that tree, your eyes will be opened,</hi> <hi rend='smallcaps'>and then ye
will be as God</hi>. (Gen. iii. 4, 5.) As far, therefore, as
man, without restraint, rushes into this love, so far he averts
himself from God, and turns to himself, and becomes a worshipper
of himself; and then he can invoke God with a warm
mouth from the love of self, but with a cold heart from contempt
of God. And then, also, the divine things of the
church may serve for means; but, because the end is dominion,
the means are regarded no more than as they are subservient
to it. Such a person, if he is exalted to the highest
honors, is, in his own imagination, like Atlas bearing the
terraqueous globe upon his shoulders, and like Phœbus, with
his horses, carrying the sun around the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Since man hereditarily is such, therefore all who, by
papal bulls, have been made saints, in the spiritual world
are removed from the eyes of others, and concealed, and all
intercourse with their worshippers is taken away from them;
the reason is, lest that most pernicious root of evil should be
excited in them, and they should be brought into such fantastic
deliriums as there are with demons. Into such deliriums
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
those come, who, while they live in the world, zealously
aspire to be made saints after death, that they may be
invoked.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Many of the Roman Catholic persuasion, especially the
monks, when they come into the spiritual world, inquire for
the saints, particularly the saint of their order; but they do
not find them, at which they wonder; but afterwards they
are instructed that they are mixed together, either with those
who are in heaven, or with those who are in the earth below;
and that, in either case, they know nothing of the worship
and invocation of themselves, and that those who do know,
and wish to be invoked, fall into deliriums, and talk foolishly.
The worship of saints is such an abomination in heaven,
that, if they only hear it, they are filled with horror; since,
as far as worship is ascribed to any man, so far it is withheld
from the Lord; for thus, he alone is not worshipped; and, if
the Lord alone is not worshipped, a discrimination is made,
which destroys communion, and the happiness of life flowing
from it. That I might know what the Roman Catholic saints
are, in order that I might make it known, as many as a
hundred were brought forth from the earth below, who knew
of their canonization. They ascended behind my back, and
only a few before my face; and I spoke with one of them,
who, they said, was Xavier. He, while he talked with me,
was like a fool; yet he could tell, that, in his place, where
he was shut up with others, he was not a fool, but that he
becomes a fool as often as he thinks that he is a saint, and
wishes to be invoked. A like murmur I heard from those
who were behind my back. It is otherwise with the saints,
so called, in heaven: these know nothing at all of what is
done on earth; nor is it given them to speak with any of the
Roman Catholic persuasion, who are in that superstition, lest
any idea of that thing should enter into them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>From this their state, every one may conclude that invocations
of them are only mockeries; and, moreover, I can
assert, that they do not hear their invocations on earth, any
more than their images do at the sides of the streets, nor any
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
more than the walls of the temple, nor any more than the
birds that build their nests in towers. It is said by their
servants on earth, that the saints reign in heaven, together
with the Lord Jesus Christ; but this is a figment and a falsehood;
for they no more reign with the Lord, than a hostler
with a king, a porter with a grandee, or a footman with a
primate; for John the Baptist said, concerning the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>that
he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoe</hi>, (Mark
1:7. John 1:27.) What, then, are those who are such?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There appears, sometimes, to the people of Paris, who
are in the spiritual world, in a society, a certain woman of a
common stature, in shining raiment, and of a face, as it
were, holy; and she says that she is <hi rend='smallcaps'>Genevieve</hi>; but, when
any begin to adore her, then her face is immediately changed,
and also her raiment, and she becomes like an ordinary
woman, and reproves them for wishing to adore a woman,
who, among her companions, is in no higher estimation than
as a maid-servant, wondering that the men of the world
should be captivated by such trifles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To the above, I shall add this, which is most worthy of
attention. Once, <hi rend='smallcaps'>Mary, the Mother of the Lord</hi>, passed
by, and was seen overhead in white raiment; and then,
stopping a while, she said that she was the mother of the
Lord, and that he was indeed born of her; but that he, being
made God, put off all the human from her, and that, therefore,
she now adores him as her God; and that she is unwilling
that any one should acknowledge him for her son,
since in him all is divine.</q>

The term <hi rend='italic'>Fighting</hi> or

<q>When the British army had possession of Philadelphia, a
committee of three of the leading men of the society of
Friends had permission to go to the head-quarters of General
Washington, relative to some matters of inconvenience of
some of their brethren, within Washington's command. The
general listened to them with his usual courtesy and wisdom,
but could not determine the business till the next day. In
the mean time, he told them he would put them under the
protection of an officer of their own society, and thereupon
sent for General Nathaniel Greene; and when he arrived, in
full uniform, he introduced <q>the Friends</q> to each other.
After a little silence, Friend James Pemberton turned slowly
to General Greene, and said, <q>Dost thou profess to be one
of our persuasion?</q> <q>O, yes,</q> said the general; <q>I was so
educated.</q> The committee looked at each other, and upon
the general's sword, when one of them said, <q>May I ask
General Greene what part of our land thou wast born and
brought up in?</q> <q>O, yes, yes,</q> replied Greene; <q>I'm from
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Rhode Island</hi>.</q> <q>Oho,</q> rejoined more than one of them,
<q>yes, yes, a <hi rend='smallcaps'>Rhode Island Quaker</hi>! Yes, Friend Greene,

<head>Dorrelites.</head>

<p>
A sectary, by the name of Dorrel, appeared in Leyden,
Mass., about fifty years ago, and made some proselytes. The
following are some of his leading sentiments:&mdash;Jesus Christ
is, as to substance, a spirit, and is God. He took a body,
died, and never rose from the dead. None of the human
race will ever rise from their graves. The resurrection,
spoken of in Scripture, is only one from sin to spiritual
life, which consists in perfect obedience to God. Written
revelation is a type of the substance of the true revelation,
which God makes to those whom he raises from spiritual
death. The substance is God revealed in the soul. Those
who have it are perfect, are incapable of sinning, and have
nothing to do with the Bible. The eternal life, purchased
by Christ, was an eternal succession of natural generation.
Heaven is light, and hell is darkness. God has no wrath.
There is no opposition between God and the devil, who have
equal power in their respective worlds of light and darkness.
Those who are raised are free from all civil laws; are not
bound by the marriage covenant; and the perfect have a
right to promiscuous intercourse. Neither prayer nor any
other worship is necessary. There is no law but that of
nature. There is no future judgment, nor any knowledge
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
in the future state, of what is done in this world. God has no
forethought, no knowledge of what passes in the dark world,
which is hell, nor any knowledge of what has taken place, or
will take place, in this world. Neither God nor the devil has
any power to control man. There are two kinds of perfection&mdash;that
of the head, and that of the members. The leader
is perfect as the head; but none of his followers can be so,
in this sense, so long as the leader continues. All covenants
which God has heretofore entered into with man, are at an
end, and a new covenant made with the leader, (Dorrel,) in
which he has all power to direct, and all the blessings of
which must be looked for through him. Neither Moses nor
Christ wrought any miracles. I (says Dorrel) stand the same
as Jesus Christ in all respects. My disciples stand in the
same relation to me, as the disciples of Christ did to him. I
am to be worshipped in the same manner as Christ was to be
worshipped, as God united to human flesh. This sect was
broken up in the following manner:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
One of Dorrel's lectures was attended by Captain Ezekiel
Foster, of Leyden, a man of good sense, of a strong, muscular
frame, and a countenance which bespoke authority. When
Dorrel came to the declaration of his extraordinary powers,
he had no sooner uttered the words, <q>No arm can hurt my
flesh,</q> than Foster rose, indignant at the imposture he was
practising on his deluded followers, and knocked down Dorrel
with his fist. Dorrel, in great trepidation, and almost senseless,
attempted to rise, when he received a second blow, at
which he cried for mercy. Foster engaged to forbear, on condition
that he would renounce his doctrines, but continued
beating him. Soon a short parley ensued, when Dorrel consented,
and did renounce his doctrines in the hearing of all
his astonished followers. He further told them, that his object
was to see what fools he could make of mankind. His followers,
ashamed and chagrined at being made the dupes of such
an unprincipled fellow, departed in peace to their homes.
Dorrel promised his assailant, upon the penalty of his life
never to attempt any similar imposition upon the people.

<head>Osgoodites.</head>

<p>
These people profess to believe in one God, who is fully
acquainted with all his own works; but they believe there
are some things done by wicked agents, of which God has no
knowledge. They reject the idea of Christ's divinity, and of
any thing special in regeneration. They pretend to miraculous
gifts, such as healing the sick, and praying down the
judgments of God upon those who oppose them. They deny
any thing peculiarly sacred in the Christian Sabbath, although
they generally meet on that day for religious worship, but
without much regard to order. They reject the ordinances
of baptism and the Lord's supper. They are opposed to
Bible societies, and other moral and religious institutions of
the day, particularly to temperance societies.
</p>

<p>
This sect arose about the year 1812, in the county of Merrimack,
N. H. where a few societies exist. Jacob Osgood is
their leader.

This is a sect calling themselves Seventh-Day Baptists,
that arose in New England about the year 1674. John and
James Rogers were their leaders. They were peculiar in
their language, dress, and manners; they employed no physician,
nor used any medicine: they paid no regard to the Christian
Sabbath, and disturbed and abused those that did. It is
said that a few of this people still remain. See the <hi rend='italic'>Battle-Axe</hi>,
a work published by them a few years ago, at their printing

<head>Whippers.</head>

<p>
This denomination sprang up in Italy, in the thirteenth
century, and was thence propagated through almost all the
countries of Europe. The society that embraced this new
discipline, ran in multitudes, composed of persons of both
sexes, and all ranks and ages, through the public streets, with
whips in their hands, lashing their naked bodies with the
most astonishing severity, with a view to obtain the divine
mercy for themselves and others, by their voluntary mortification
and penance. This sect made their appearance anew
in the fourteenth century, and taught, among other things,
that flagellation was of equal virtue with baptism and other
sacraments; that the forgiveness of all sins was to be obtained
by it from God, without the merit of Jesus Christ; that the
old law of Christ was soon to be abolished, and that a new
law, enjoining the baptism of blood, to be administered by
whipping, was to be substituted in its place.
</p>

<p>
A new denomination of Whippers arose in the fifteenth
century, who rejected the sacraments and every branch of
external worship, and placed their only hopes of salvation in
<emph>faith</emph> and <emph>flagellation</emph>.

<head>Wilkinsonians.</head>

<p>
The followers of Jemima Wilkinson, who was born in
Cumberland, R. I. In 1776, she asserted that she was taken
sick, and actually died, and that her soul went to heaven.
Soon after, her body was reanimated with the spirit and
power of Christ, upon which she set up as a public teacher,
and declared she had an immediate revelation for all she
delivered, and was arrived to a state of absolute perfection.
It is also said she pretended to foretell future events, to discern
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
the secrets of the heart, and to have the power of healing
diseases; and if any person who had made application to
her was not healed, she attributed it to his want of faith. She
asserted that those who refused to believe these exalted things
concerning her, will be in the state of the unbelieving Jews,
who rejected the counsel of God against themselves; and she
told her hearers that was the eleventh hour, and the last call
of mercy that ever should be granted them; for she heard an
inquiry in heaven, saying, <q>Who will go and preach to a
dying world?</q> or words to that import; and she said she
answered, <q>Here am I&mdash;send me;</q> and that she left the
realms of light and glory, and the company of the heavenly
host, who are continually praising and worshipping God, in
order to descend upon earth, and pass through many sufferings
and trials for the happiness of mankind. She assumed
the title of the <hi rend='italic'>universal friend of mankind</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Jemima made some converts in Rhode Island and New
York, and died in 1819. She is said to have been a very
beautiful, but artful woman.

they substituted water in the holy communion, though some
refused it only in their <emph>morning</emph> ceremonies. It is well
known that the ancient Christians mingled water with their
wine for sacred use, partly, perhaps, for economy, and partly
from sobriety; but Cyprian gives a mystical reason&mdash;because
the wine and water represent Christ and his people
united.

<head>Baxterians.</head>

<p>
The Baxterian strikes into a middle path between Arminianism
and Calvinism, and thus endeavors to unite both
schemes. With the Calvinist, he professes to believe that a
certain number, determined upon in the divine councils, will
be infallibly saved; and with the Arminian, he joins in rejecting
the doctrine of reprobation, as absurd and impious;&mdash;admits
that Christ, in a certain sense, died for all, and
supposes that such a portion of grace is allotted to <emph>every</emph>
man, as renders it his own fault if he does not attain to
eternal life.
</p>

<p>
This conciliatory system was espoused by the famous Nonconformist,
Richard Baxter, who was celebrated for the
acuteness of his controversial talents, and the utility of his
practical writings.
</p>

<p>
Among Baxterians are ranked both Watts and Doddridge.
Dr. Doddridge, indeed, has this striking remark&mdash;<q>That a
Being who is said not to tempt any one, and even swears
that he desires not the death of a sinner, should <emph>irresistibly</emph>
determine millions to the commission of every sinful action
of their lives, and then, with all the pomp and pageantry of
a universal judgment, condemn them to eternal misery, on
account of these actions, that hereby he may promote the
happiness of others who are, or shall be, irresistibly determined
to virtue, in the like manner, is of all incredible things
to me the most incredible!</q>
</p>

<p>
In the scale of religious sentiment, Baxterianism seems to
be, with respect to the subject of divine favor, what Arianism
is with respect to the person of Christ. It appears to have
been considered by some pious persons as a safe middle way
between two extremes.

<head>Miller's Views on the Second Coming of Christ.</head>

<p>
The following letter from Rev. <hi rend='smallcaps'>William Miller</hi> to Rev.
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Joshua V. Himes</hi> contains a synopsis of Mr. Miller's views
on this interesting subject:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Rev. J. V. Himes:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>My dear brother: You have requested a synopsis
of my views of the Christian faith. The following sketch
will give you some idea of the religious opinions I have
formed, by a careful study of the word of God:&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I believe all men, coming to years of discretion, do and
will disobey God; and this is, in some measure, owing to
corrupted nature by the sin of our parent. I believe God
will not condemn us for any pollution in our father; but the
soul that sinneth shall die. All pollution of which we may
be partakers from the sins of our ancestors, in which we
could have no agency, can and will be washed away in the
blood and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, without our agency. But
all sins committed by us as rational, intelligent agents, can
only be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, through our
repentance and faith. I believe in the salvation of all men
who receive the grace of God by repentance and faith in the
mediation of Jesus Christ. I believe in the condemnation
of all men who reject the gospel and mediation of Christ,
and thereby lose the efficacy of the blood and righteousness
of our Redeemer, as proffered to us in the gospel. I believe
in practical godliness, as commanded us in the Scriptures,
(which are our only rule of faith and practice,) and that they
only will be entitled to heaven and future blessedness, who
obey and keep the commandments of God, as given us in the
Bible, which is the word of God. I believe in God, the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is a Spirit, omnipresent,
omniscient, having all power, Creator, Preserver, and self-existent.
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
As being holy, just, and beneficent, I believe in Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, having a body in fashion and form
like man, divine in his nature, human in his person, godlike
in his character and power. He is a Savior for sinners, a
Priest to God, a Mediator between God and man, and King
in Zion. He will be all to his people, God with us forever.
The spirit of the Most High is in him, the power of the Most
High is given him, the people of the Most High are purchased
by him, the glory of the Most High shall be with him, and
the kingdom of the Most High is his on earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I believe the Bible is the revealed will of God to man, and
all therein is necessary to be understood by Christians in the
several ages and circumstances to which they may refer;&mdash;for
instance, what may be understood to-day, might not have
been necessary to have been understood a thousand years ago;
for its object is to reveal things new and old, that the man
of God may be thoroughly furnished for, and perfected in,
every good word and work, for the age in which he lives.
I believe it is revealed in the best possible manner for all
people, in every age and under every circumstance, to understand,
and that it is to be understood as literal as it can be
and make good sense; and that in every case where the
language is figurative, we must let the Bible explain its own
figures. We are in no case allowed to speculate on the
Scriptures, and suppose things which are not clearly expressed,
nor reject things which are plainly taught. I believe
all of the prophecies are revealed to try our faith, and to give
us hope, without which we could have no reasonable hope.
I believe that the Scriptures do reveal unto us, in plain language,
that Jesus Christ will appear again on this earth; that
he will come in the glory of God, in the clouds of heaven,
with all his saints and angels; that he will raise the dead
bodies of all his saints who have slept, change the bodies of
all that are alive on the earth that are his, and both these
living and raised saints will be caught up to meet the Lord
in the air. There the saints will be judged and presented
to the Father, without spot or wrinkle. Then the gospel
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
kingdom will be given up to God the Father. Then will the
Father give the bride to the Son Jesus Christ; and when the
marriage takes place, the church will become the <q>New
Jerusalem,</q> the <q>beloved city.</q> And while this is being
done in the air, the earth will be cleansed by fire, the elements
will melt with fervent heat, the works of men will be
destroyed, the bodies of the wicked will be burned to ashes,
the devil and all evil spirits, with the souls and spirits of those
who have rejected the gospel, will be banished from the earth,
shut up in the pit or place prepared for the devil and his
angels, and will not be permitted to visit the earth again until
a thousand years. This is the first resurrection, and first
judgment. Then Christ and his people will come down from
the heavens, or middle air, and live with his saints on the
new earth in a new heaven, or dispensation, forever, even
forever and ever. This will be the restitution of the right
owners to the earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then will the promise of God to his Son be accomplished&mdash;<q>I
will give him the heathen for his inheritance, and
the utmost parts of the earth for his possession.</q> Then <q>the
whole earth shall be full of his glory.</q> And then will the
holy people take possession of their joint heirship with Christ,
and his promise be verified, <q>The meek shall inherit the
earth,</q> and the kingdom of God will have come, and <q>his
will done in earth as in heaven.</q> After a thousand years
shall have passed away, the saints will all be gathered and
encamped in the beloved city. The sea, death, and hell, will
give up their dead, which will rise up on the breadths of the
earth, out of the city, a great company like the sand of the
sea-shore. The devil will be let loose, to go out and deceive
this wicked host. He will tell them of a battle against the
saints, the beloved city; he will gather them in the battle
around the camp of the saints. But there is no battle; the
devil has deceived them. The saints will judge them; the
justice of God will drive them from the earth into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where they will be tormented day and
night, forever and ever. <q>This is the second death.</q> After
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
the second resurrection, second judgment, the righteous will
then possess the earth forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I understand that the judgment day will be a thousand
years long. The righteous are raised and judged in the
commencement of that day, the wicked in the end of that
day. I believe that the saints will be raised and judged about
the year 1843, according to Moses' prophecy, Lev. ch. 26;
Ezek. ch. 39; Daniel, ch. 2, 7, 8-12; Hos. 5:1-3; Rev.,
the whole book; and many other prophets have spoken of
these things. Time will soon tell if I am right, and soon he
that is righteous will be righteous still, and he that is filthy
will be filthy still. I do most solemnly entreat mankind to
make their peace with God, to be ready for these things. 'The
end of all things is at hand.' I do ask my brethren in the
gospel ministry to consider well what they say before they
oppose these things. Say not in your hearts, <q>My Lord delayeth
his coming.</q> Let all do as they would wish they had
if it does come, and none will say they have not done right
if it does not come. I believe it will come; but if it should
not come, then I will wait and look until it does come. Yet
I must pray, <q>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This is a synopsis of my views. I give it as a matter of
faith. I know of no scripture to contradict any view given
in the above sketch. Men's theories may oppose. The ancients
believed in a temporal and personal reign of Christ on
earth. The moderns believe in a temporal, spiritual reign
as a millennium. Both views are wrong; both are too gross
and carnal. I believe in a glorious, immortal, and personal
reign of Jesus Christ, with all his people, on the purified earth
forever. I believe the millennium is between the two resurrections
and two judgments, the righteous and the wicked,
the just and the unjust. I hope the dear friends of Christ
will lay by all prejudice, and look at and examine these three
views by the only rule and standard, the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Bible</hi>.</q>

The believers in Mr. Miller's theory are numerous, and
converts to his doctrines are increasing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Miller was born at Hampton, N. Y., Feb. 15, 1782.
He is a farmer, of common school education, and possesses
strong intellectual and colloquial powers. He is a man of
unexceptionable character, is a member of the Baptist church,
in good standing, and has a license to preach the gospel.
For the last fifteen years, he has almost exclusively devoted
himself to investigating Scripture prophecies, and in promulgating
his peculiar views of them to the world.

<p>
The Rev J. V. Himes and Rev. J. Litch, No. 14 Devonshire
Street, Boston, publish the <hi rend='italic'>Signs of the Times</hi>, a
weekly paper, devoted to Miller's views. They also publish
Miller's works, and a variety of other books, embracing
similar sentiments.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Come-Outers.</head>

<p>
This is a term which has been applied to a considerable
number of persons in various parts of the Northern States,
principally in New England, who have recently <hi rend='italic'>come out</hi> of
the various religious denominations with which they were
connected;&mdash;hence the name. They have not themselves
assumed any distinctive name, not regarding themselves as a
sect, as they have not formed, and do not contemplate forming,
any religious organization. They have no creed, believing
that every one should be left free to hold such <emph>opinions</emph>
on religious subjects as he pleases, without being held accountable
for the same to any human authority. Hence, as
might be expected, they hold a diversity of opinions on many
points of belief upon which agreement is considered essential
by the generality of professing Christians. Amongst other
subjects upon which they differ is that of the authority of the
Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments, some among
them holding the prevailing belief of their divine inspiration,
whilst others regard them as mere human compositions, and
subject them to the same rules of criticism as they do any
other book, attaching to them no authority any further than
they find evidence of their truth. They believe the commonly-received
opinion of the plenary inspiration of the writers
of those books to be unfounded, not claimed by the writers
themselves, and therefore <emph>unscriptural</emph>, as well as unreasonable.
Whilst, then, they believe the authors of the Gospels to
have been fallible men, liable to err both in relation to matters
of fact and opinion, they believe they find in their
writings abundant evidence of their honesty. Therefore
they consider their testimony satisfactory as regards the
main facts there stated of the life of Jesus Christ, at least so
far, that there can be no difficulty in deducing therefrom the
great principles of the religion which he taught. They <emph>all</emph>
believe him to have been a divinely-inspired teacher, and his
religion, therefore, to be a revelation of eternal truth. They
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
regard him as the only authorized expositor of his own religion,
and believe that to apply in practice its principles as
promulgated by him, and as exemplified in his life, is all that
is essential to constitute a Christian, according to his testimony,
(Matt. 7:24,)&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Whosoever heareth these sayings
of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man
which built his house upon a rock,</hi></q> &amp;c. Hence they believe
that to make it essential to Christianity to assent to all the
opinions expressed by certain men, good men though they
were, who wrote either before or after his time, involves a
denial of the words of Christ. They believe that, according
to his teachings, true religion consists in purity of heart,
holiness of life, and not in opinions; that <hi rend='italic'>Christianity, as it
existed in the mind of Christ, is a life rather than a belief</hi>.
</p>

<p>
This class of persons agree in the opinion that <hi rend='italic'>he only is
a Christian who has the spirit of Christ</hi>; that all such as
these are members of his church, and that it is composed of
none others; therefore that membership in the Christian
church is not, and cannot, in the nature of things, be determined
by any human authority. Hence they deem all attempts
to render the church identical with any outward
organizations as utterly futile, not warranted by Christ himself,
and incompatible with its spiritual character. Having
no organized society, they have no stations of authority or
superiority, which they believe to be inconsistent with the
Christian idea, (Matt. 23:8,)&mdash;<q>But be not ye called Rabbi:
for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.</q>
(Matt. 20:25, 26,)&mdash;<q>Ye know that the princes of the
Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are
great exercise authority upon them. <hi rend='italic'>But it shall not be so
among you.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
As might be inferred from the foregoing, they discard all
outward ordinances as having no place in a spiritual religion
the design of which is to purify the heart, and the extent of
whose influence is to be estimated, by its legitimate effects in
producing a life of practical righteousness, and not by any
mere arbitrary sign, which cannot be regarded as a certain
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
indication of the degree of spiritual life, and must consequently
be inefficient and unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
Their views of worship correspond, as they believe, with
the spiritual nature of the religion they profess. They believe
that true Christian worship is independent of time and place;
that it has no connection with forms, and ceremonies, and external
arrangements, any further than these are the exponents
of a divine life; that it spontaneously arises from the pure in
heart at all times and in all places: in short, they regard the
terms <hi rend='italic'>Christian worship</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Christian obedience</hi> as synonymous,
believing that he gives the highest and only conclusive
evidence of worshipping the Creator, who exhibits in his life
the most perfect obedience to his will. These views they
consider in perfect harmony with the teachings of Jesus, particularly
in his memorable conversation with the woman of
Samaria.
</p>

<p>
They also agree in the belief that the religion of Christ
asserts the equality of all men before God; that it confers
upon no man, or class of men, a monopoly of Heaven's favors;
neither does it give to a portion of his children any means of
knowing his will not common to the race. They believe the
laws of the soul are so plain that they may be easily comprehended
by all who sincerely seek to know them, without
the intervention of any human teacher or expounder. Hence
they regard no teaching as authoritative but that of the Spirit
of God, and reject all priesthoods but the universal priesthood
which Christianity establishes. They believe that every one
whose soul is imbued with a knowledge of the truth is qualified
to be its minister, and it becomes his duty and his pleasure,
by his every word and action, to preach it to the world.
It follows, then, that, as Christ prepares and appoints his own
ministers, and as they receive their commissions only from
him, they are accountable to him alone for their exercise,
and not to any human authority whatsoever. They therefore
reject all human ordinations, appointments, or control, or any
designation by man of an order of men to preach the gospel,
as invasions of his rightful prerogative.
</p>

<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>

<p>
Amongst the prevailing sins, against which they feel bound
to bear testimony, are slavery and war; and it is alleged as
the main reason why many of them have disconnected themselves
from the professedly Christian denominations to which
they belonged, that those bodies gave their sanction to those
anti-Christian practices. They believe slaveholding to be
sinful under all circumstances, and that, therefore, it should
be immediately abandoned. They believe, not only that
national wars are forbidden by Christianity, but that the
taking of human life for any purpose, by governments or individuals,
is incompatible with its spirit. A large proportion
of them, also, consider all resort to punishment, as a penalty
for crime, equally inconsistent with the law of love. Hence
they deem it their duty to withhold their voluntary sanction
or support from human governments, and all institutions
which claim the right to exercise powers which they thus
regard as unlawful.
</p>

<p>
In various places, these persons hold meetings on the first
day of the week, which are conducted consistently with their
views of Christian freedom and equality. It is understood
that the object of thus meeting together, is to promote their
spiritual welfare. For this purpose, they encourage a free
interchange of sentiment on religious subjects, without any
restraint or formality. They have no prescribed exercises,
but every one is left free to utter his thoughts as he may feel
inclined; and even those who differ from them in opinion are
not only at liberty, but are invited, to give expression to their
thoughts. They believe this to be the only mode of holding
religious meetings consistent with the genius of their religion,
and for an example of like gatherings they refer to those
of the primitive Christians. They meet on the <hi rend='italic'>first day of
the week</hi>, not because they believe it incumbent to devote that
portion of time more than any other to objects regarded as
peculiarly religious,&mdash;for they regard all days as equally holy,
and equally devoted to the service of the Lord,&mdash;but merely
because they have become habituated to abstain from their
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
ordinary occupations on that day, and it is, therefore, the most
convenient time for them to assemble.
</p>

<p>
The practical acknowledgment of the moral equality of
the sexes is another distinguishing characteristic of these
people. They regard woman as equally qualified to hold any
station in society from which she is not excluded by her
physical disability; and that she alone must decide for herself
what position she shall occupy, or what duties in the
community she shall perform; the control of woman never,
as they conceive, having been delegated to man by the Creator.
Therefore they consider her equal in all mental and
intellectual pursuits. And when they associate together for
religious and benevolent objects, they exercise the various
duties pertaining to them indiscriminately.
</p>

<p>
The number of persons who hold a similarity of opinions
on these subjects cannot be known. It is, at present, comparatively
small, but rapidly increasing.
</p>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Jumpers.</head>

<p>
Persons so called from the practice of jumping during
the time allotted for religious worship. This singular practice
began, it is said, in the western part of Wales, about
the year 1760. It was soon after defended by Mr. William
Williams, (the Welsh poet, as he is sometimes called,) in a
pamphlet, which was patronized by the abettors of jumping
in religious assemblies. Several of the more zealous itinerant
preachers encouraged the people to cry out, <q><hi rend='italic'>Goganiant</hi>,</q>
(the Welsh word for <hi rend='italic'>glory</hi>,)
<q>Amen,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c., to put themselves
in violent agitations, and, finally, to jump until they
were quite exhausted, so as often to be obliged to fall down
on the floor, or the field, where this kind of worship was
held.

<head>Baptists.</head>

<p>
This denomination of Christians holds that a personal profession
of faith and an immersion in water are essential to
baptism. There are several bodies of Baptists in the United
States, which will be found under their different names. The
<hi rend='italic'>Regular</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>Associated
Baptists</hi> are, in sentiment, moderate
Calvinists, and form the most numerous body of Baptists in
this country.
</p>

<p>
The Baptists being Independent, or Congregational, in their
form of church government, their ecclesiastical assemblies
disclaim all right to interfere with the concerns of individual
churches. Their public meetings, by delegation from different
churches, are held for the purpose of mutual advice and improvement,
but not for the general government of the whole
body.
</p>

<p>
The following Declaration of Faith, with the Church Covenant,
was recently published by the Baptist Convention of New
Hampshire, and is believed to express, with little variation, the
general sentiments of the Regular or Associated Baptists:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the Scriptures.</hi>&mdash;We
believe the Holy Bible
was written by men divinely inspired, and is a perfect treasure
of heavenly instruction; that it has God for its Author, salvation
for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for
its matter; that it reveals the principles by which God will
judge us, and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of
the world, the true centre of Christian union, and the supreme
standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions,
should be tried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>II. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the true
God.</hi>&mdash;That there is one, and only
one, true and living God, whose name is JEHOVAH, the
Maker and Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth; inexpressibly
glorious in holiness; worthy of all possible honor, confidence,
and love; revealed under the personal and relative
distinctions of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>
equal in every divine perfection, and executing distinct but
harmonious offices in the great work of redemption.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>III. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of
the Fall of Man.</hi>&mdash;That man was created in
a state of holiness, under the law of his Maker, but by voluntary
transgression fell from that holy and happy state; in
consequence of which all mankind are now sinners, not by
constraint, but choice; being by nature utterly void of that
holiness required by the law of God, wholly given to the gratification
of the world, of Satan, and of their own sinful passions,
and therefore under just condemnation to eternal ruin,
without defence or excuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>IV. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the
Way of Salvation.</hi>&mdash;That the salvation
of sinners is wholly of grace, through the mediatorial offices
of the Son of God, who took upon him our nature, yet without
sin; honored the law by his personal obedience, and
made atonement for our sins by his death; being risen from
the dead, he is now enthroned in heaven; and uniting in his
wonderful person the tenderest sympathies with divine perfections,
is every way qualified to be a suitable, a compassionate,
and an all-sufficient Savior.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>V. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of
Justification.</hi>&mdash;That the great gospel blessing
which Christ, of his fulness, bestows on such as believe in
him, is justification; that justification consists in the pardon
of sin and the promise of eternal life, on principles of righteousness;
that it is bestowed, not in consideration of any
works of righteousness which we have done, but solely
through his own redemption and righteousness; that it brings
us into a state of most blessed peace and favor with God, and
secures every other blessing needful for time and eternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>VI. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the Freeness
of Salvation.</hi>&mdash;That the blessings
of salvation are made free to all by the gospel; that it
is the immediate duty of all to accept them by a cordial and
obedient faith; and that nothing prevents the salvation of
the greatest sinner on earth, except his own voluntary refusal
to submit to the Lord Jesus Christ; which refusal will subject
him to an aggravated condemnation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>VII. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of Grace
in Regeneration.</hi>&mdash;That, in order to
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>
be saved, we must be regenerated, or born again; that regeneration
consists in giving a holy disposition to the mind, and
is effected in a manner above our comprehension or calculation,
by the power of the Holy Spirit, so as to secure our
voluntary obedience to the gospel; and that its proper evidence
is found in the holy fruit which we bring forth to the
glory of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>VIII. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of God's
Purpose of Grace.</hi>&mdash;That election is
the gracious purpose of God, according to which he regenerates,
sanctifies, and saves sinners; that, being perfectly consistent
with the free agency of man, it comprehends all the
means in connection with the end; that it is a most glorious
display of God's sovereign goodness, being infinitely wise,
holy, and unchangeable; that it utterly excludes boasting, and
promotes humility, prayer, praise, trust in God, and active
imitation of his free mercy; that it encourages the use of
means in the highest degree; that it is ascertained by its
effects in all who believe the gospel; is the foundation of
Christian assurance; and that to ascertain it with regard to
ourselves, demands and deserves our utmost diligence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>IX. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the Perseverance of Saints.</hi>&mdash;That such
only are real believers as endure unto the end; that their
persevering attachment to Christ is the grand mark which
distinguishes them from superficial professors; that a special
Providence watches over their welfare; and they are kept by
the power of God through faith unto salvation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>X. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Harmony of the Law and Gospel.</hi>&mdash;That the
law of God is the eternal and unchangeable rule of his moral
government; that it is holy, just, and good; and that the inability
which the Scriptures ascribe to fallen men to fulfil its
precepts, arises entirely from their love of sin; to deliver
them from which, and to restore them, through a Mediator,
to unfeigned obedience to the holy law, is one great end of
the gospel, and of the means of grace connected with the
establishment of the visible church.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XI. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of a
Gospel Church.</hi>&mdash;That a visible church of
Christ is a congregation of baptized believers, associated by
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel; observing
the ordinances of Christ; governed by his laws; and exercising
the gifts, rights, and privileges, invested in them by his
word; that its only proper officers are bishops, or pastors, and
deacons, whose qualifications, claims, and duties, are defined
in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XII. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper.</hi>&mdash;That
Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water, in
the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit; to show forth, in a
solemn and beautiful emblem, our faith in a crucified, buried,
and risen Savior, with its purifying power; that it is prerequisite
to the privileges of a church relation, and, to the
Lord's supper, in which the members of the church, by the
use of bread and wine, are to commemorate together the
dying love of Christ,&mdash;preceded always by solemn self-examination.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XIII. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of
the Christian Sabbath.</hi>&mdash;That the first day
of the week is the Lord's day, or Christian Sabbath, and is to
be kept sacred to religious purposes, by abstaining from all
secular labor and recreations; by the devout observance of
all the means of grace, both private and public; and by
preparation for that rest which remaineth for the people of
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XIV. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of Civil
Government.</hi>&mdash;That civil government
is of divine appointment, for the interests of good order of
human society; and that magistrates are to be prayed for,
conscientiously honored, and obeyed, except in things opposed
to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only Lord of
the conscience, and the Prince of the kings of the earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XV. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the Righteous and the Wicked.</hi>&mdash;That
there is a radical and essential difference between the righteous
and the wicked; that such only as through faith are
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and sanctified by the
Spirit of our God, are truly righteous in his esteem; while all
such as continue in impenitence and unbelief are in his sight
wicked, and under the curse; and this distinction holds
among men both in and after death.</q>
</p>

<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>XVI. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Of the
World to come.</hi>&mdash;That the end of this
world is approaching; that, at the last day, Christ will descend
from heaven, and raise the dead from the grave to final retribution;
that a solemn separation will then take place; that
the wicked will be adjudged to endless punishment, and the
righteous to endless joy; and that this judgment will fix
forever the final state of men, in heaven or hell, on principles
of righteousness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Church
Covenant.</hi>&mdash;having been, as we trust, brought
by divine grace to embrace the Lord Jesus Christ, and to give
up ourselves wholly to him, we do now solemnly and joyfully
covenant with each other, <hi rend='smallcaps'>to walk together in him with
brotherly love</hi>, to his glory as our common Lord. We
do, therefore, in his strength engage,</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That we will exercise a mutual care, as members one of
another, to promote the growth of the whole body in Christian
knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to the end that we may
stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That, to promote and secure this object, we will uphold
the public worship of God and the ordinances of his house,
and hold constant communion with each other therein; that
we will cheerfully contribute of our property for the support
of the poor, and for the maintenance of a faithful ministry of
the gospel among us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That we will not omit closet and family religion at home,
nor allow ourselves in the too common neglect of the great
duty of religiously training up our children, and those under
our care, with a view to the service of Christ and the enjoyment
of heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That we will walk circumspectly in the world, that we
may win their souls; remembering that God hath not given
us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound
mind, that we are the light of the world and the salt of the
earth, and that a city set on a hill cannot be hid.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That we will frequently exhort, and, if occasion shall
require, admonish, one another, according to Matthew 18th,
in the spirit of meekness; considering ourselves, lest we also
<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>
be tempted; and that, as in baptism, we have been buried
with Christ, and raised again, so there is on us a special
obligation henceforth, to walk in newness of life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And may the God of peace, who brought again from
the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make us perfect
in every good work to do his will; working in us that
which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to
whom be glory forever and ever. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Amen.</hi></q>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This denomination claims an immediate descent from the
apostles, and asserts that the constitution of their churches is
from the authority of Jesus Christ himself, and his immediate
successors. Many others, indeed, deduce their origin as a
sect from much later times, and affirm that they first sprang
up in Germany in the sixteenth century. This denomination
of Christians is distinguished from others by their opinions
respecting the mode and subjects of baptism. Instead of
administering the ordinance by sprinkling or pouring water,
they maintain that it ought to be administered only by immersion:
such, they insist, is the meaning of the Greek word
<foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>baptizo</foreign>,
to wash or dip, so that a command to baptize is a
command to immerse. They also defend their practice from
the phrase <hi rend='italic'>buried with him in baptism</hi>,
from the first administrators'
repairing to rivers, and the practice of the primitive
church, after the apostles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With regard to the <emph>subjects</emph> of baptism, this denomination
alleges that it ought not to be administered to children or
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>
infants at all, nor to adults in general; but to those only who
profess repentance for sin and faith in Christ. Our Savior's
commission to his apostles, by which Christian baptism was
instituted, is to <hi rend='italic'>go and teach all nations, baptizing them</hi>,
&amp;c., that is, not to baptize all they meet with, but first to examine
and instruct them, and whoever will receive instruction, to
baptize in the <hi rend='italic'>name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost</hi>. This construction of the passage is confirmed
by another passage&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature; he that believeth, and is baptized,
shall be saved.</hi></q> To such persons, and to such only,
this denomination says, baptism was administered by the
apostles and the immediate disciples of Christ; for those who
were baptized in primitive times are described as repenting
of their sins, and believing in Christ. (See Acts 2:38, 8:37,
and other passages of Scripture.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>They further insist that all positive institutions depend
entirely upon the will and declaration of the institutor; and
that, therefore, reasoning by analogy from previous abrogated
rites is to be rejected, and the express commands of Christ
respecting the mode and subjects of baptism ought to be our
only rule.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They observe that the meaning of the word
<foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>baptizo</foreign>
signifies immersion or dipping only; that John baptized in
Jordan; that he chose a place where there was <emph>much</emph> water;
that Jesus came up <emph>out of</emph> the water; that Philip and the
eunuch went down both <emph>into</emph> the water; that the terms
<hi rend='italic'>washing</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>purifying</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>burying in baptism</hi>, so often mentioned
in Scripture, allude to this mode; that immersion <emph>only</emph> was
the practice of the apostles and the first Christians; and that
it was only laid aside from the love of novelty, and the coldness
of our climate. These positions, they think, are so
clear from Scripture, and the history of the church, that
they stand in need of but little argument to support them.</q>

<p>
There are some interesting facts connected with the history
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
of the Baptists in America. In 1631, the Rev. Roger
Williams, who had been a clergyman of the church of England,
but, disliking its formalities, seceded, and ranged himself
with the Nonconformists, fled to America from the persecutions
which then raged in England. The great principles
of civil and religious liberty were not then understood in
the western world, and, as Mr. Williams was a man of intrepid
firmness in advocating those principles, we are not
surprised at the excitement and opposition which his doctrines
awakened. He settled first in Salem, New England, the
magistracy of which condemned his opinions, and subsequently
sentenced him to banishment. Under that cruel act of
legislation, he was driven from his family, in the midst of
winter, to seek for refuge among the wild Indians. After
great sufferings, having conciliated the Indians, he commenced
the formation of a colony, to which he gave the
name of <hi rend='italic'>Providence</hi>, situate in Rhode Island, a name which
it still bears.
</p>

<p>
Thus he became the founder of a new order of things.
Several of his friends afterwards joined him, and in that infant
settlement he sustained the twofold character of minister and
lawgiver. He formed a constitution on the broad principle
of civil and religious liberty, and thus became the first ruler
that recognized equal rights. Nearly a century and a half
after that, when the Americans achieved their independence,
thirteen of the states united in forming a government for
themselves, and adopted that principle; thus America became,
what the little colony of Providence had been before,
a refuge for the persecuted for conscience sake. It has been
well observed that the millions in both hemispheres who are
now rejoicing in the triumph of liberal principles, should
unite in erecting a monument to perpetuate the memory of
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Roger Williams</hi>, the first governor who held liberty of
conscience, as well as of person, to be the birthright of
man.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1639, Mr. Williams formed the <emph>first</emph> Baptist
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
church in America, at Providence. Throughout succeeding
years, few changes, comparatively, were experienced in the
movements of the Baptist denomination on this vast continent.
Baptist churches multiplied exceedingly, until they assumed
a leading attitude among the religious communities of America.
They have amply provided for an efficient and learned
ministry, and the extraordinary revivals with which they have
been frequently favored, invest them with a moral strength
and glory which cannot be contemplated but with astonishment
and admiration.

<head>Anabaptists.</head>

<p>
Those who maintain that baptism ought always to be performed
by immersion. The word is compounded of <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>ana</foreign>
<q>new,</q> and <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>baptistes</foreign>,
<q>a Baptist,</q> signifying that those who
have been baptized in their infancy, ought to be baptized
<emph>anew</emph>. It is a word which has been indiscriminately applied
to Christians of very different principles and practices. The
English and Dutch Baptists do not consider the word as
at all applicable to their sect, because those persons whom
they baptize they consider as never having been baptized
before, although they have undergone what they term the
ceremony of sprinkling in their infancy.

<head>Free-Will Baptists.</head>

<p>
The first church gathered, of this order, was in New
Durham, N. H., in the year 1780, principally by the instrumentality
of Elder Benjamin Randall, who then resided in
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>
that town. Soon after, several branches were collected
which united with this church; and several preachers, of
different persuasions, were brought to see the beauties of a
<emph>free salvation</emph>, and united as fellow-laborers with Elder
Randall.
</p>

<p>
They believe that, by the death of Christ, salvation was
provided for all men; that, through faith in Christ, and
sanctification of the Spirit,&mdash;though by nature entirely sinners,&mdash;all
men may, if they improve every means of grace
in their power, become new creatures in this life, and, after
death, enjoy eternal happiness; that all who, having actually
sinned, die in an unrenewed state, will suffer eternal
misery.
</p>

<p>
Respecting the divine attributes of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, they in substance agree with other Orthodox
Christians. They hold the holy Scriptures to be their only
rule of religious faith and practice, to the exclusion of all
written creeds, covenants, rules of discipline, or articles of
organization. They consider that elders and deacons are
the officers of the church designed in the Scriptures, and
maintain that piety, and a call to the work, are the essential
qualifications of a minister, without regard to literary
attainments.

<head>Seventh-Day Baptists, Or Sabbatarians,</head>

<p>
Are those who keep the seventh day of the week as the
Sabbath. They are to be found principally, if not wholly,
among the Baptists. They object to the reasons which are
generally alleged for keeping the first day, and assert that the
change from the seventh to the first was effected by Constantine,
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
on his conversion to Christianity, A. D. 321. The
three following propositions contain a summary of their principles
as to this article of the Sabbath, by which they stand
distinguished:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. That God hath required the seventh or last day of every
week to be observed by mankind, universally, for the weekly
Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
2. That this command of God is perpetually binding on
man till time shall be no more.
</p>

<p>
3. That this sacred rest of the seventh-day Sabbath is not
by divine authority changed from the seventh and last to the
first day of the week, and that the Scripture doth nowhere
require the observation of any other day of the week for the
weekly Sabbath, but the seventh day only. They hold, in
common with other Christians, the distinguishing doctrines
of Christianity.

<head>Six-Principle Baptists.</head>

<p>
This appellation is given to those who hold the imposition
of hands, subsequent to baptism, and generally on the admission
of candidates into the church, as an indispensable
prerequisite for church membership and communion. They
support their peculiar principle chiefly from Heb. 6:1,
2&mdash;<q>Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of
Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the
foundation of repentance from dead works, and faith toward
God, of the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands,
and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment,</q>
As these two verses contain six distinct propositions, one of
which is the laying on of hands, these brethren have, from
thence, acquired the name of <hi rend='italic'>Six-Principle Baptists</hi>, to
distinguish them from others, whom they sometimes call
<hi rend='italic'>Five-Principle Baptists</hi>. They have fourteen churches in

<head>Pedobaptists.</head>

<p>
Are those who practise the baptism of children, without
regard to personal faith.
</p>

<p>
Pedobaptists, in common with all others, claim for their
practice an apostolical origin; and, although they differ much
in theological opinions, in forms of church government, and
modes of worship, yet they all adopt substantially the same
mode of reasoning in their defence of pedobaptism. They
say that the church, under both the old and new dispensations,
has ever been the same, although under a different
form; that infants, as well as parents, were admitted into the
church under the earlier dispensations, the rite of circumcision
being the sign of their introduction, into it; and that
the Christian dispensation (as the Savior came not to destroy,
but to fulfil, the law and the prophets) did not annul
or abridge any of the privileges of the church that were possessed
under the dispensations of former times. But as the
right of children, who are bound to their parents by the
strongest natural tie, to be solemnly and visibly dedicated to
God, and to come within the pale and under the watch of the
church, is a blessing and a privilege, we are entitled to ask
for the passages in the New Testament which require its
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
abandonment. We take it for granted, that children are to
be publicly dedicated to God, now, as in former times, unless
some positive directions can be shown to the contrary. It
appearing, therefore, that children may be dedicated to God,
by their parents, in some public and visible way, and there
remaining no outward ceremony, under the Christian dispensation,
suitable to that purpose, but baptism, we infer that
baptism is designed to take the place of circumcision, and
that children may be baptized. And these views are thought
to be encouraged by the affectionate saying of Christ, <q>Suffer
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for
of such is the kingdom of God.</q> (Mark 10:14.)
</p>

<p>
A second argument in favor of infant baptism is derived
from the repeated accounts, in the Acts, of the baptism of
whole families. The families referred to are those of Lydia,
a seller of purple in the city of Thyatira, of the jailer, in the
same city, and of Cornelius, the centurion, of Cæsarea.
Instances of this kind are not to be considered as conclusively
proving the Scripture authority of infant baptism of themselves;
but they form a presumptive argument, in its favor,
of great weight.
</p>

<p>
And, further, it may be shown, from ecclesiastical history,
that the baptism of infants was practised in the time of the
primitive Christians. This being the fact, the conclusion
seems to follow irresistibly, that they received the practice
from the apostles, and that it was, therefore, known and
recognized by the Savior himself; and, if it were known and
recognized by him, or even introduced, subsequently and
solely, by those he commissioned, it must be received, in
either case, as the will of Christ, and as a law of the Christian
dispensation.
</p>

<p>
Again, they say that the particular mode of baptism can
not be determined from the meaning of the word
<foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>baptizo</foreign>,
which may mean either to immerse or to lave, according to
the particular connection in which it is found. (See Mark
7:4. Heb. 9:10.)
</p>

<p>
None of the accounts of baptism, which are given in the
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
New Testament, necessarily imply that it was performed by
immersion. It is true the Savior and the eunuch, when they
were baptized, went up out of, or rather <emph>from</emph>, the water,
but the inference that they went <emph>under</emph> the water, which is
sometimes drawn from these expressions, does not appear to
be sufficiently warranted.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances attending the baptism of the jailer and
his family are of such a nature as to render the opinion of
its being performed by immersion improbable. The baptism
was evidently performed at midnight, and within the limits
of the prison,&mdash;a time and a situation evidently implying
some other mode than plunging. Similar views will hold in
respect to the baptism of the three thousand at the season of
Pentecost.
</p>

<p>
As, therefore, there are no passages of Scripture which
positively require immersion, but various scriptural considerations
against it, besides its being always inconvenient,
and not unfrequently impracticable, the Pedobaptists have
ever thought it fit and requisite, as a general rule, to practise
baptism by sprinkling or laving.
</p>

<p>
The Greek church, in all its branches,&mdash;whether in the
frozen regions of Siberia, or in the torrid zone,&mdash;practise
trine immersion. All Pedobaptists require of adults, who
seek for baptism, a personal profession of their faith, and
so far agree with the Baptists. They also, with the Baptists,
allow immersion to be valid baptism; but, in opposition to
them, the Baptists deny that any other mode of administering
this rite is valid. (See Exod. 14:22. Isa. 44:3. Matt.
3:11; 19:13. Mark 7:4. Acts 2:39; 19:2, 5. Rom.
4:11; 11:17. 1 Cor. 7:14; 10:2. Eph. chap. 2. Heb.
9:10, 13, 14.)
</p>

<p>
The term <hi rend='italic'>Pedobaptist</hi> is derived
from two Greek words&mdash;<foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>pais</foreign>,
a child, and <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>baptismos</foreign>,
baptism. This mode of baptism
is practised by nearly the whole Christian world, except the

in the United States, and who are also called <hi rend='italic'>Liberal Christians</hi>,
are mostly Congregationalists, and are found principally
in New England.
</p>

<p>
They acknowledge no other rule of faith and practice than
the holy Scriptures, which they consider it the duty of every
man to search for himself, prayerfully, and with the best
exercise of his understanding. They reject all creeds of
human device, as generally unjust to the truth of God and
the mind of man, tending to produce exclusiveness, bigotry,
and divisions, and at best of doubtful value. They regard,
however, with favor the earliest creed on record, commonly
called the Apostles', as approaching nearest to the simplicity
of the gospel, and as imbodying the grand points of the
Christian faith.
</p>

<p>
They adopt the words of St. Paul, (1 Cor. 8:6,) <q><hi rend='italic'>To us
there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and
we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by him.</hi></q> They make great account of the
doctrine of God's paternal character and government, and
continually set it forward as the richest source of consolation,
and the most powerful motive to repentance and improvement.
</p>

<p>
Receiving and trusting in Christ as their Lord, Teacher,
Mediator, Intercessor, Savior, they hold in less esteem
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
than many other sects, nice theological questions and speculations
concerning his precise rank, and the nature of his
relation to God. They feel that by honoring him as <hi rend='italic'>the Son
of God</hi>, they honor him as he desired to be honored; and
that by obeying and imitating him, they in the best manner
show their love.
</p>

<p>
They believe that the Holy Ghost is not a distinct person
in the Godhead, but that <hi rend='italic'>power of God</hi>,
that <hi rend='italic'>divine influence</hi>,
by which Christianity was established through miraculous
aids, and by which its spirit is still shed abroad in the hearts
of men.
</p>

<p>
They advocate the most perfect toleration. They regard
<hi rend='smallcaps'>charity</hi> as the crowning Christian grace,&mdash;the end of the
commandment of God. They consider a pure and lofty
morality as not only inseparable from true religion, but the
most acceptable service that man can render to his Maker,
and the only indubitable evidence of a believing heart.
</p>

<p>
They believe that sin is its own punishment, and virtue its
own rewarder; that the moral consequences of a man's good
or evil conduct go with him into the future life, to afford him
remorse or satisfaction; that God will be influenced in all
his dealings with the soul by mercy and justice, punishing
no more severely than the sinner deserves, and always for a
benevolent end. Indeed, the greater part of the denomination
are Restorationists.
</p>

<p>
Unitarians consider that, besides the Bible, all the Ante-Nicene
fathers&mdash;that is, all Christian writers for three
centuries after the birth of Christ&mdash;give testimony in their
favor, against the modern popular doctrine of the Trinity.
As for <emph>antiquity</emph>, it is their belief that it is really on their
side.
</p>

<p>
In the <hi rend='italic'>First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians</hi>, which
was written towards the close of the first century,&mdash;and the
evidence for the genuineness of which is stronger than for
that of any other of the productions attributed to the apostolical
fathers,&mdash;the supremacy of the Father is asserted or
implied throughout, and Jesus is spoken of in terms mostly
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
borrowed from the Scriptures. He is once called the
<q>sceptre of the majesty of God;</q> and this highly-figurative
expression is the most exalted applied to him in the whole
Epistle.
</p>

<p>
Justin Martyr, the most distinguished of the ancient
fathers of the church, who flourished in the former part of
the second century, and whose writings (with the exception
of those attributed to the <emph>apostolic</emph> fathers) are the earliest
Christian records next to the New Testament, expressly says,
<q>We worship God, the Maker of the universe, offering up to
him prayers and thanks. But, assigning to Jesus, who came
to teach us these things, and for this end was born, the
<q><emph>second place</emph></q> after God, we not without reason honor him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The germ and origin of the doctrine of the Trinity, the
Unitarians find in the speculations of those Christianized
philosophers of the second century, whose minds were
strongly tinctured with the Platonic philosophy, combined
with the <hi rend='italic'>emanation system</hi>, as taught at Alexandria, and
held by Philo. From this time they trace the gradual
formation of the doctrine through successive ages down to
Athanasius and Augustine; the former of whom, A. D. 362,
was the first to insist upon the equality of the Holy Ghost
with the Father and the Son; and the latter, about half a
century afterwards, was the first to insist upon their numerical
unity.
</p>

<p>
In all ages of the church, there have been many learned
and pious men who have rejected the Trinity as unscriptural
and irrational. The first attempt, at the council of Nice, to
establish and make universal the Trinitarian creed, caused
disturbances and dissensions in the church, which continued
for ages, and produced results the most deplorable to every
benevolent mind which exalts <emph>charity</emph> over faith.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the reformation, the Unitarian faith was
avowed by Martin Cellarius, who was then finishing his
studies at Wittenberg, where Luther was professor. In
1546, the Unitarian opinions made a considerable movement
in Italy, and several persons of learning and eminence were
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
put to death. In 1553, Michael Servetus was burned for
this heresy, at Geneva. The elder Socinus made his escape
from this persecution, and spread his views throughout several
countries of Europe, more particularly in Poland, where
a large part of the Reformed clergy embraced them, and were
separated, in 1565, from the communion of the Calvinists
and Lutherans.
</p>

<p>
In England, the number of Unitarians was considerable,
according to Strype, as early as 1548; and in 1550, he represents
the Unitarian doctrine as spreading so fast that the
leading Churchmen were alarmed, and <q>thought it necessary
to suppress its expression by rigid measures.</q> These <q>rigid
measures,</q> such as imprisonment and burning, were successful
for a time. But afterwards, the <q>heresy</q> gained
new and able supporters, such as Biddle, Firmin, Dr. S.
Clarke, Dr. Lardner, Whiston, Emlyn, Sir Isaac Newton,
&amp;c., and has been spreading to this day.
</p>

<p>
In the north of Ireland, the Unitarians compose several
presbyteries. There are also congregations of Unitarians in
Dublin, and in other southern cities of the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
In Scotland, there are chapels of this character in Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and other principal places.
</p>

<p>
In the United States, Unitarian opinions were not prevalent
till towards the close of the last century. Since that
time, however, they have advanced rapidly, and have been
embraced by some of the wisest and best men in the land.
</p>

<p>
Of late years, the Congregational Unitarians have generally
abstained from controversy, in the United States. They
have, however, published and circulated extensively a large
number of tracts, of a doctrinal and practical character.
They have at the present time assumed a <emph>positive</emph> condition,
gained a strong and permanent hold amongst the Christian
sects, and are manifesting new signs of vitality and usefulness.
</p>

<p>
The following proof-texts are some of those upon which
the Unitarians rest their belief in the inferiority of the Son to
the Father:&mdash;John 8:17, 18. John 17:3. Acts 10:38
1 Tim. 2:5. 1 John 4:14. Rom. 8:34 1 Cor. 11:3.

<head>Brownists.</head>

<p>
A denomination which sprung up in England towards
the close of the sixteenth century. They derive their name
from their leader, Robert Brown.
</p>

<p>
This denomination did not differ in point of doctrine from
the church of England, or from the other Puritans; but they
apprehended, according to Scripture, that every church ought
to be confined within the limits of a single congregation,
and that the government should be democratical. They
maintained the discipline of the church of England to be
Popish and antichristian, and all her ordinances and sacraments
invalid. Hence they forbade their people to join with
them in prayer, in hearing the word, or in any part of public
worship. They not only renounced communion with the
church of England, but with all other churches, except such
as were of the same model.

This name was given to a party which appeared in England

They acquired this denomination from their professed

<head>Bourignonists.</head>

<p>
The followers of Antoinette Bourignon, a lady in France,
who pretended to particular inspirations. She was born at
Lisle, in 1616. At her birth, she was so deformed that
it was debated some days in the family whether it was
not proper to stifle her as a monster; but, her deformity
diminishing, she was spared, and afterwards obtained such a
degree of beauty, that she had her admirers. From her
childhood to her old age she had an extraordinary turn of
mind. She set up for a reformer, and published a great
number of books, filled with very singular notions; the most
remarkable of which are entitled <q>The Light of the World,</q>
and <q>The Testimony of Truth.</q> In her confession of faith,
she professes her belief in the Scriptures, the divinity and
atonement of Christ. She believed, also, that man is perfectly
free to resist or receive divine grace; that God is ever
unchangeable love towards all his creatures, and does not
inflict any arbitrary punishment, but that the evils they suffer
are the natural consequence of sin; that religion consists not
in outward forms of worship, nor systems of faith, but in an
entire resignation to the will of God. She held many extravagant
notions, among which, it is said, she asserted that
Adam, before the fall, possessed the principles of both sexes,
that, in an ecstasy, God represented Adam to her mind in his
original state, as also the beauty of the first world, and how
he had drawn from it the chaos; and that every thing was
bright, transparent, and darted forth life and ineffable glory,
with a number of other wild ideas. She dressed like a hermit,
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
and travelled through France, Holland, England, and
Scotland. She died at Franeker, in the province of Frise,
October 30, 1680.

<head>Jews.</head>

<p>
A complete system of the religious doctrines of the Jews
is contained in the five books of Moses, their great lawgiver,
who was raised up to deliver them from their bondage in
Egypt, and to conduct them to the possession of Canaan, the
promised land.
</p>

<p>
The principal sects among the Jews, in the time of our
Savior, were the Pharisees, who placed religion in external
ceremony; the Sadducees, who were remarkable for their
incredulity; and the Essenes, who were distinguished by an
austere sanctity.
</p>

<p>
The Pharisees and Sadducees are frequently mentioned in
the New Testament; and an acquaintance with their principles
and practices serves to illustrate many passages in the
sacred history. At present, the Jews have two sects&mdash;the
Caraites, who admit no rule of religion but the law of Moses;
and the Rabbinists, who add to the laws the tradition of the
Talmud, a collection of the doctrines and morality of the
Jews. The expectation of a Messiah is the distinguishing feature
of their religious system. The word <hi rend='italic'>Messiah</hi> signifies
one anointed, or installed into an office by an unction.
</p>

<p>
Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, in
whom all the Jewish prophecies are accomplished. The
Jews, infatuated with the idea of a temporal Messiah, who is
to subdue the world, still wait for his appearance.
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable periods in the history of the Jews
are the call of Abraham, the giving of the law by Moses,
their establishment in Canaan under Joshua, the building of
the temple by Solomon, the division of the tribes, their captivity
in Babylon, their return under Zerubbabel and the
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
destruction of their city and temple by Titus, afterwards
emperor, A. D. 70.
</p>

<p>
Maimonides, an illustrious rabbi, drew up for the Jews, in
the eleventh century, a confession of faith, which all Jews
admit. It is as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. I believe, with a true and perfect faith, that God is
the Creator, whose name be blessed, Governor, and Maker, of
all creatures, and that he hath wrought all things, worketh
and shall work forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the Creator, whose
name be blessed, is <emph>one</emph>, and that such a unity as in him
can be found in none other, and that he alone hath been our
God, is, and forever shall be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the Creator, whose
name be blessed, is not corporeal, nor to be comprehended
with any bodily property, and that there is no bodily essence
that can be likened unto him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. I believe, with a perfect faith, the Creator, whose
name be blessed, to be the first and the last, that nothing was
before him, and that he shall abide the last forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the Creator, whose
name be blessed, is to be worshipped, and none else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. I believe, with a perfect faith, that all the words of
the prophets are true.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. I believe, with a perfect faith, the prophecies of
Moses, our master,&mdash; may he rest in peace;&mdash;that he was
the father and chief of all wise men that lived before him, or
ever shall live after him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. I believe, with a perfect faith, that all the law which
at this day is found in our hands, was delivered by God
himself to our master, Moses. God's peace be with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the same law is
never to be changed, nor another to be given us of God,
whose name be blessed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>10. I believe, with a perfect faith, that God, whose name
be blessed, understandeth all the works and thoughts of
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>
men, as it is written in the prophets. He fashioneth their
hearts alike; he understandeth all their works.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>11. I believe, with a perfect faith, that God will recompense
good to them that keep his commandments, and will
punish them who transgress them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>12. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the Messiah is
yet to come; and, although he retard his coming, yet I will
wait for him till he come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>13. I believe, with a perfect faith, that the dead shall be
restored to life, when it shall seem fit unto God the Creator,
whose name be blessed, and memory celebrated, world without
end. <hi rend='smallcaps'>Amen.</hi></q>

<p>
This people constitute one of the most singular and interesting
portions of mankind. For about three thousand years,
they have existed as a distinct nation; and, what is remarkable,
by far the greatest part of this time they have been in
bondage and captivity.
</p>

<p>
The calling of Abraham, the father and founder of this
nation; the legislation of Moses; the priesthood of Aaron:
the Egyptian bondage; the conquest of Canaan, and the
history of the Jews to the coming of the Messiah; their cruel
and injurious treatment of this august and innocent personage,&mdash;are
facts which the Scriptures disclose, and with which,
it is presumed, every reader is well acquainted.
</p>

<p>
For about eighteen hundred years, this wonderful people
have maintained their peculiarities of religion, language, and
domestic habits, among Pagans, Mahometans, and Christians,
and have suffered a continued series of reproaches,
privations, and miseries, which have excited the admiration
and astonishment of all who have reflected on their condition.
</p>

<p>
The siege and destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, the
Roman general, was one of the most awful and distressing
scenes that mortals ever witnessed; and the details, as given
by Josephus, are enough to make humanity shudder. During
the siege, which lasted nearly five months, upwards of
eleven hundred thousand Jews perished. John and Simon,
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
the two generals of the Hebrews, who were accounted the
ringleaders of the rebellious nation, with seven hundred of
the most beautiful and vigorous of the Jewish youth, were
reserved to attend the victor's triumphal chariot. The number
taken captive, during this fatal contest, amounted to
ninety-seven thousand; many of whom were sent into Syria,
and the other provinces, to be exposed in public theatres, to
fight like gladiators, or to be devoured by wild beasts. The
number of those destroyed in the whole war, of which
the taking of the holy city was the bloody and tremendous
consummation, is computed to have been one million, four
hundred and sixty thousand.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the terrors of the Roman sword, this
devoted nation was exposed to famine, pestilence, and the
implacable fury of contending parties among themselves,
which all conspired together to make the siege of Jerusalem
surpass, in horror, every account of any other siege in the
records of the world.
</p>

<p>
A small portion, indeed, of this wretched, ruined nation
were permitted to remain, and establish themselves in Judea,
who, by degrees, reorganized a regular system of government,
which became the centre of Jewish operations, not only for
those in Judea, but for such as were dispersed in other nations.
But the yoke of foreign masters was so grievous and
burdensome, that they were continually restless and impatient;
and, in consequence of a general revolt under the
emperor Adrian, in 134, they were a second time slaughtered
in multitudes, and were driven to madness and despair.
Bither, the place of their greatest strength, was compelled
to surrender, and Barchochba, their leader, who pretended
to be the Messiah, was slain, and five hundred and eighty
thousand fell by the sword in battle, besides vast numbers
who perished by famine, sickness, fire, and other calamities.
</p>

<p>
Kings have enacted the severest laws against them, and
employed the hand of executioners to ruin them. The seditious
multitudes, by murders and massacres, have committed
outrages against them, if possible, still more violent and
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
tragical. Besides their common share in the sufferings of
society, they have undergone a series of horrid and unutterable
calamities, which no other description of men has ever
experienced in any age, or in any country. Princes and
people, Pagans, Mahometans, and Christians, disagreeing in
so many things, have united in the design of exterminating
this fugitive and wretched race, but have not succeeded.
They have been banished, at different times, from France,
Germany, Spain, Bohemia, Hungary, and England; and
from some of these kingdoms they have been banished and
recalled many times in succession.
</p>

<p>
The Romans and Spaniards have probably done more
than any other nations to oppress and destroy this people;
and the inquisition has doomed multitudes of them to torture
and death.
</p>

<p>
At different times, they were accused of poisoning wells,
rivers, and reservoirs of water, and, before any proof of these
strange and malicious charges was produced, the populace
in many parts of Germany, Italy, and France, have fallen
upon them with merciless and murderous severity. At one
time, the German emperor found it necessary to issue an
edict for their banishment, to save them from the rage of his
exasperated and unrestrained subjects.
</p>

<p>
As the Jews have generally been the <emph>bankers</emph> and <emph>brokers</emph>
of the people among whom they have resided, and have made
a show of much wealth, this has tempted their avaricious
adversaries to impose upon them enormous taxes and ruinous
fines.
</p>

<p>
Muley Archy, a prince of one of the Barbary states, by
seizing the property of a rich Jew, was enabled to dispossess
his brother of the throne of Morocco.
</p>

<p>
The English parliament of Northumberland, in 1188, for
the support of a projected war, assessed the Jews with 60,000
pounds, while only 70,000 were assessed upon the Christians;
which proves either that the Jews were immensely rich, or
that the parliament was extremely tyrannical.
</p>

<p>
The English king John was unmercifully severe upon this
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
afflicted people. In 1210, regardless of the costly freedom he
had sold them, he subjected them all, as a body, to a fine of
60,000 marks. The ransom required by this same unfeeling
king, of a rich Jew of Bristol, was 10,000 marks of silver; and
on his refusing to pay this ruinous fine, he ordered one of his
teeth to be extracted every day; to which the unhappy man
submitted seven days, and on the eighth day he agreed to
satisfy the king's rapacity. Isaac of Norwich was, not long
after, compelled to pay a similar fine. But the king, not
satisfied with these vast sums extorted from these injured
Israelites, in the end confiscated all their property, and expelled
them from the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of the 16th century, the Jews in
Persia were subjected to a tax of two millions of gold.
Long would be the catalogue of injuries of this kind, which
this outcast and hated nation has sustained. Numerous are
the cases in which those who have become deeply in debt to
them for borrowed money, have procured their banishment,
and the confiscation of their property, as the readiest way to
cancel their demands; and, as they have ever been addicted
to usurious practices, they have, by this means, furnished
plausible pretexts to their foes to fleece and destroy them.
</p>

<p>
The fraternal disposition of this people led them to seek
the society of each other; and, notwithstanding the wideness
of their dispersion, in process of time, they, by uniting under
different leaders, formed two communities of considerable
extent, known by the name of the eastern and western Jews.
The western Jews inhabited Egypt, Judea, Italy, and other
parts of the Roman empire; the eastern Jews settled in
Babylon, Chaldea, Persia, &amp;c. The head of the western
division was known by the name of the patriarch, while he
who presided over the eastern Jews, was called the prince of
the captivity. The office of patriarch was abolished, by imperial
laws, about 429, from which time the western Jews
were solely under the rule of the chiefs of their synagogues,
whom they called primates. But the princes of the captivity
had a longer and more splendid sway. They resided at
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
Babylon, or Bagdad, and exercised an extensive authority
over their brethren, as far down as the 12th century. About
this period, a Jewish historian asserts that he found, at Bagdad,
the prince of the captivity, lineally descended from
David, and permitted, by the caliph, to exercise the rights
of sovereignty over the Jews from Syria to Indostan.
</p>

<p>
The existence of a succession of these imaginary potentates,
from the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the
Jews have ever been strenuous in maintaining, partly to
aggrandize their nation, and partly to deprive Christians of
the benefit of an argument furnished by the prophecy of
Jacob, concerning the termination of the Jewish polity and
independence, soon after the coming of the Messiah.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the world, in general, has shown a spirit
of hostility and contempt for the remnant of Israel, yet they
have found a few, in every age, who, either from motives of
policy or justice, have treated them with kindness and respect.
The first Mahometan caliphs, a number of the Roman
pontiffs, and some of the Asiatic and European sovereigns,
have shown them friendship and protection. Don Solomon,
a learned and illustrious Jew of Portugal, in the 12th century,
was raised to the highest military command in that kingdom.
Casimir the Great, of Poland, in the 14th century, received
the Jews as refugees into his kingdom, and granted them
extensive privileges; and from that time to the present, they
have been more numerous in that country than in any other
in Europe.
</p>

<p>
For many centuries, this persecuted race found a favorite
asylum in Holland, and, by their dexterity and success in
commerce, became very affluent.
</p>

<p>
Cromwell, seeing the benefit which the Netherlands had
derived from this money-making and money-lending community,
was very desirous to recall them to England, from which
they had been exiled about three hundred and fifty years.
The celebrated Manasses Ben Israel had many interviews
with the Protector; and so high were the expectations of the
Israelites, from the clemency and authority of this illustrious
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
statesman, that they began to look up to him as the promised
Messiah. And, although Cromwell's friendly proposals, as
to their recall, were overruled by the bigoted and intolerant
policy of the times, yet, from that period, they have found
favor and protection in England, and have been much more
numerous and prosperous there than formerly.
</p>

<p>
In France and the United States, the Jews are admitted to
equal rights with all other citizens, which cannot be said of
any other nations in Christendom. In the United States, they
have acquired this freedom, of course, with all other citizens
of this free country. In France, they were admitted to it
by Bonaparte; and afterwards, in 1807, by his directions, they
convened a Grand Sanhedrim, consisting, according to ancient
custom, of 70 members, exclusive of the president.
The number and distinction of the spectators of this Sanhedrim
greatly added to the solemnity of the scene. This
venerable assembly passed and agreed to various articles
respecting the Mosaic worship, and their civil and ecclesiastical
concerns.
</p>

<p>
The extreme aversion of the Jews to every thing which
bears the Christian name, and their obstinate attachment to
their ancient religion, have, in former years, discouraged all
attempts to convert them to the Christian faith. And not
only has their conversion been neglected, but for many centuries
they have been persecuted, plundered, and destroyed,
by those who have called themselves Christians; they have
not been permitted to enter their churches as worshippers,
nor their dwellings as guests, nor reside in their territories,
where Pagans and Mahometans have found an unmolested
abode. While we, then, blame the blindness and incredulity
of the descendants of Abraham, let us lament the folly and
unkindness of the professed disciples of the mild and compassionate
Redeemer. But a different spirit is now prevailing
in many parts of Christendom, and a new era, as to the tribes
of Israel, seems about to burst upon the world. Societies
are formed in Europe and America for their benefit, and a
disposition is said to be increasing, among the Jews, favorable
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
to that Messiah and that religion which they have so long
hated and rejected.
</p>

<p>
The history of this people certainly forms a striking evidence
of the truth of divine revelation. They are a living
and perpetual miracle, continuing to subsist as a distinct and
peculiar race for upwards of three thousand years, intermixed
among almost all the nations of the world, flowing forward in
a full and continued stream, like the waters of the Rhone,
without mixing with the waves of the expansive lake through
which the passage lies to the ocean of eternity.

<p>
The natives of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Canada</hi> have an idea of the Supreme
Being; and they all, in general, agree in looking upon him
as the First Spirit, and the Governor and the Creator of the
world. It is said that almost all the nations of the Algonquin
language give this Sovereign Being the appellation of
the Great Hare. Some, again, call him Michabou, and
others Atahocan. Most of them hold the opinion that he
was born upon the waters, together with his whole court,
entirely composed of four-footed animals, like himself; that
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>
he formed the earth of a grain of sand, which he took from
the bottom of the ocean; and that he created man of the
bodies of the dead animals. There are, likewise, some who
mention a god of the waters, who opposed the designs of the
Great Hare, or, at least, refused to be assisting to him. This
god is, according to some, the Great Tiger. They have a
third, called Matcomek, whom they invoke in the winter
season.
</p>

<p>
The Agreskoui of the Hurons, and the Agreskouse of the
Iroquois, is, in the opinion of these nations, the Sovereign
Being, and the god of war. These Indians do not give the
same original to mankind with the Algonquins; they do not
ascend so high as the first creation. According to them, there
were, in the beginning, six men in the world; and, if you ask
them who placed them there, they answer you, they do not
know.
</p>

<p>
The gods of the Indians have bodies, and live much in
the same manner as themselves, but without any of those
inconveniences to which they are subject. The word <hi rend='italic'>spirit</hi>,
among them, signifies only a being of a more excellent nature
than others.
</p>

<p>
According to the Iroquois, in the third generation there
came a deluge, in which not a soul was saved; so that, in
order to repeople the earth, it was necessary to change
beasts into men.
</p>

<p>
Beside the First Being, or the Great Spirit, they hold an
infinite number of genii, or inferior spirits, both good and
evil, who have each their peculiar form of worship.
</p>

<p>
They ascribe to these beings a kind of immensity and
omnipresence, and constantly invoke them as the guardians
of mankind. But they never address themselves to the evil
genii, except to beg of them to do them no hurt.
</p>

<p>
They believe in the immortality of the soul, and say that
the region of their everlasting abode lies so far westward,
that the souls are several months in arriving at it, and have
vast difficulties to surmount. The happiness which they
hope to enjoy is not believed to be the recompense of virtue
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
only; but to have been a good hunter, brave in war, &amp;c., are
the merits which entitle them to this paradise, which they,
and the other American natives, figure as a delightful country,
blessed with perpetual spring, whose forests abound with
game, whose rivers swarm with fish, where famine is never
felt, and uninterrupted plenty shall be enjoyed without labor
or toil.
</p>

<p>
The natives of <hi rend='smallcaps'>New England</hi> believed not only a plurality
of gods, who made and governed the several nations of the
world, but they made deities of every thing they imagined to
be great, powerful, beneficial, or hurtful to mankind. Yet
they conceived an Almighty Being, who dwells in the south-west
regions of the heavens, to be superior to all the rest.
This Almighty Being they called Kichtan, who at first, according
to their tradition, made a man and woman out of a
stone, but, upon some dislike, destroyed them again; and
then made another couple out of a tree, from whom descended
all the nations of the earth; but how they came to
be scattered and dispersed into countries so remote from one
another, they cannot tell. They believed their Supreme God
to be a good being, and paid a sort of acknowledgment to
him for plenty, victory, and other benefits.
</p>

<p>
But there is another power, which they called <hi rend='italic'>Hobamocko</hi>,
(the devil,) of whom they stood in greater awe, and worshipped
merely from a principle of fear.
</p>

<p>
The immortality of the soul was universally believed among
them. When good men die, they said, their souls go to
Kichtan, where they meet their friends, and enjoy all manner
of pleasures; when wicked men die, they go to Kichtan
also, but are commanded to walk away, and wander about in
restless discontent and darkness forever.
</p>

<p>
After the coming of the white people, the Indians in <hi rend='smallcaps'>New
Jersey</hi>, who once held a plurality of deities, supposed there
were only three, because they saw people of three kinds of
complexion, viz., English, negroes, and themselves.
</p>

<p>
It was a notion generally prevailing among them, that
the same God who made them did not make us, but
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
that they were created after the white people; and it is probable
they supposed their God gained some special skill by
seeing the white people made, and so made them better; for
it is certain they considered themselves and their methods
of living, which they said their God expressly prescribed for
them, vastly preferable to the white people and their methods.
</p>

<p>
With regard to a future state of existence, many of them
imagined that the Chichung, i. e., the shadow, or what survives
the body, will, at death, go southward, to some unknown,
but curious place,&mdash;will enjoy some kind of happiness, such
as hunting, feasting, dancing, or the like; and what they
suppose will contribute much to their happiness in the next
state, is, that they shall never be weary of these entertainments.
</p>

<p>
Those who have any notion about rewards and sufferings
in a future state, seem to imagine that most will be happy,
and that in the delightful fields, chasing the game, or reposing
themselves with their families; but the poor, frozen
sinners cannot stir one step towards that sunny region.
Nevertheless, their misery has an end; it is longer or shorter,
according to the degree of their guilt; and, after its expiation,
they are permitted to become inhabitants of the
Indian paradise.
</p>

<p>
The Indians of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Virginia</hi> gave
the names of <hi rend='italic'>Okee</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Quioccos</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>Kiwasa</hi>, to the idol which they worshipped. These
names might possibly be so many epithets, which they varied
according to the several functions they ascribed to this deity,
or the different notions they might form to themselves of it in
their religious exercises and common discourses. Moreover,
they were of opinion that this idol is not one sole being, but
that there were many more of the same nature, besides the
tutelary gods. They gave the general name of Quioccos to
all these genii, or beings, so that the name of Kiwasa might
be particularly applied to the idol in question.
</p>

<p>
These savages consecrated chapels and oratories to this
deity, in which the idol was often represented under a variety
of shapes. They even kept some of these in the most retired
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>
parts of their houses, to whom they communicated their
affairs, and consulted them upon occasion. In this case, they
made use of them in the quality of tutelary gods, from whom
they supposed they received blessings on their families.
</p>

<p>
The sacerdotal vestment of their priests was like a
woman's petticoat plaited, which they put about their necks,
and tied over the right shoulder; but they always kept one
arm out, to use it as occasion required. This cloak was
made round at bottom, and descended no lower than the
middle of the thigh; it was made of soft, well-dressed skins,
with the hair outwards.
</p>

<p>
These priests shaved their heads close, the crown excepted,
where they left only a little tuft, that reached from the
top of the forehead to the nape of the neck, and even on the
top of the forehead. They here left a border of hair, which,
whether it was owing to nature, or the stiffness contracted
by the fat and colors with which they daubed themselves,
bristled up, and came forward like the corner of a square cap.
</p>

<p>
The natives of Virginia had a great veneration for their
priests; and the latter endeavored to procure it, by daubing
themselves all over in a very frightful manner, dressing themselves
in a very odd habit, and tricking up their hair after a
very whimsical manner. Every thing they said was considered
as an oracle, and made a strong impression on the minds of
the people; they often withdrew from society, and lived in
woods or in huts, far removed from any habitation. They
were difficult of access, and did not give themselves any
trouble about provisions, because care was always taken to
set food for them near their habitations. They were always
addressed in cases of great necessity. They also acted in
the quality of physicians, because of the great knowledge
they were supposed to have of nature. In fine, peace or war
was determined by their voice; nor was any thing of importance
undertaken without first consulting them.
</p>

<p>
They had not any stated times nor fixed days, on which
they celebrated their festivals, but they regulated them only
by the different seasons of the year; as, for instance, they
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
celebrated one day at the arrival of their wild birds, another
upon the return of the hunting season, and for the maturity
of their fruits; but the greatest festival of all was at harvest
time. They then spent several days in diverting themselves,
and enjoyed most of their amusements, such as martial
dances and heroic songs.
</p>

<p>
After their return from war, or escaping some danger,
they lighted fires, and made merry about them, each having
his gourd-bottle, or his little bell, in his hand. Men, women,
and children, often danced in a confused manner about these
fires. Their devotions, in general, consisted only of acclamations
of joy, mixed with dances and songs, except in
seasons of sorrow and affliction, when they were changed
into howlings. The priests presided at this solemnity,
dressed in their sacerdotal ornaments, part of which were
the gourd-bottle, the petticoat above mentioned, and the
serpents' or weasels' skins, the tails of which were dexterously
tied upon their heads like a tiara, or triple crown.
These priests began the song, and always opened the religious
exercise, to which they often added incantations, part
of the mysteries of which were comprehended in the songs.
The noise, the gestures, the wry faces, in a word, every thing,
contributed to render these incantations terrible.

<head>Deists.</head>

<p>
The Deists believe in a God, but reject a written revelation
from him. They are extravagant in their encomiums
on natural religion, though they differ much respecting its
nature, extent, obligation, and importance. Dr. Clarke, in
his treatise on Deism, divides them into four classes, according
to the number of articles comprised in their creed.
</p>

<p>
The first are such as pretend to believe the existence of
in eternal, infinite, independent, intelligent Being, and who,
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
to avoid the name of Epicurean Atheists, teach also that this
Supreme Being made the world; though, at the same time,
they agree with the Epicureans in this&mdash;that they fancy God
does not at all concern himself in the government of the
world, nor has any regard to, or care of, what is done therein.
</p>

<p>
The second sort of Deists are those who believe not only
the being, but also the providence, of God, with respect to
the <emph>natural</emph> world, but who, not allowing any difference between
moral good and evil, deny that God takes any notice
of the morally good or evil actions of men; these things
depending, as they imagine, on the arbitrary constitution of
human laws.
</p>

<p>
A third sort of Deists there are, who, having right apprehensions
concerning the natural attributes of God and his
all-governing providence, and some notion of his moral perfections
also, yet, being prejudiced against the notion of the
immortality of the soul, believe that men perish entirely at
death, and that one generation shall perpetually succeed
another, without any further restoration or renovation of
things.
</p>

<p>
A fourth and last sort of Deist are such as believe the
existence of a Supreme Being, together with his providence
in the government of the world; also all the obligations of
natural religion, but so far only as these things are discoverable
by the light of nature alone, without believing any
divine revelation.
</p>

<p>
These, the learned author observes, are the only true
Deists; but, as their principles would naturally lead them to
embrace the Christian revelation, he concludes there is now
no consistent scheme of Deism in the world. Dr. Clarke
then adds, <q>The heathen philosophers&mdash;those few of them
who taught and lived up to the obligations of natural religion&mdash;had,
indeed, a consistent scheme of Deism, as far as it went.
But the case is not so now; the same scheme is not any
longer consistent with its own principles; it does not now
lead men to embrace revelation, as it then taught them to
hope for it. Deists in our days, who reject revelation when
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>
offered to them, are not such men as Socrates and Cicero
were; but, under pretence of Deism, it is plain they are
generally ridiculers of all that is truly excellent in natural
religion itself. Their trivial and vain cavils; their mocking
and ridiculing without and before examination; their directing
the whole stress of objections against particular customs,
or particular and perhaps uncertain opinions or explications
of opinions, without at all considering the main body of
religion; their loose, vain, and frothy discourses; and, above
all, their vicious and immoral lives,&mdash;show, plainly and undeniably,
that they are not real Deists, but mere Atheists, and,
consequently, not capable to judge of the truth of Christianity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dr. Paley observes, <q>Of what a revelation discloses to
mankind, one, and only one, question can be properly asked.&mdash;Was
it of importance to mankind to know or to be better
assured of? In this question, when we turn our thoughts to
the great Christian doctrine of a resurrection from the dead
and a future judgment, no doubt can be possibly entertained.
He who gives me riches or honors does nothing; he who
even gives me health, does little in comparison with that
which lays before me just grounds for expecting a restoration
to life, and a day of account and retribution, which
thing Christianity hath done for millions.</q>
</p>

<head>Atheists.</head>

<p>
The Atheists are those who deny the existence of God;
this is called <emph>speculative</emph> Atheism. Professing to believe in
God, and yet acting contrary to this belief, is called <emph>practical</emph>
Atheism. Absurd and irrational as Atheism is, it has had
its votaries and martyrs. In the seventeenth century, Spinosa
was its noted defender. Lucilio Venini, a native of
Naples also publicly taught Atheism in France; and, being
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>
convicted of it at Toulouse, was condemned and executed in
1619. It has been questioned, however, whether any man
ever seriously adopted such a principle.
</p>

<p>
Archbishop Tillotson says, <q>I appeal to any man of reason,
whether any thing can be more unreasonable than obstinately
to impute an effect to chance, which carries in the very face
of it all the arguments and characters of a wise design and
contrivance. Was ever any considerable work in which
there were required a great variety of parts, and a regular and
orderly disposition of those parts, done by chance? Will
chance fit means to ends, and that in ten thousand instances,
and not fail in any one? How often might a man, after he
had jumbled a set of letters in a bag, fling them out upon the
ground, before they would fall into an exact poem! yea, or so
much as make a good discourse in prose! And may not a
little book be as easily made by chance as the great volume
of the world? How long might a man be in sprinkling colors
upon canvass with a careless hand, before they would
happen to make the exact picture of a man! And is a man
easier made by chance than his picture? How long might
twenty thousand blind men, who should be sent out from
several remote parts of England, wander up and down before
they would all meet upon Salisbury Plain, and fall into rank
and file in the exact order of an army! And yet this is
much more easy to be imagined than how the innumerable
blind parts of matter should rendezvous themselves into a
world. A man that sees Henry the Seventh's chapel at
Westminster, might with as good reason maintain (yea, with
much better, considering the vast difference betwixt that
little structure and the huge fabric of the world) that it was
never contrived or built, by any means, but that the stones did
by chance grow into those curious figures into which they
seem to have been cut and graven; and that, upon a time, (as
tales usually begin,) the materials of that building&mdash;the stone,
mortar, timber, iron, lead, and glass&mdash;happily met together,
and very fortunately ranged themselves into that delicate
order in which we see them now, so close compacted, that it
<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>
must be a very great chance that parts them again. What
would the world think of a man that should advance such an
opinion as this, and write a book for it? If they would do
him right, they ought to look upon him as mad; but yet with
a little more reason than any man can have to say that the
world was made by chance, or that the first men grew up out
of the earth as plants do now. For can any thing be more
ridiculous, and against all reason, than to ascribe the production
of men to the first fruitfulness of the earth, without so
much as one instance and experiment, in any age or history,
to countenance so monstrous a supposition? The thing is,
at first sight, so gross and palpable, that no discourse about
it can make it more apparent. And yet these shameful beggars
of principles give this precarious account of the original
of things; assume to themselves to be the men of reason, the
great wits of the world, the only cautious and wary persons,
that hate to be imposed upon, that must have convincing
evidence for every thing, and can admit of nothing without a
clear demonstration of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lord Bacon remarks, that <q>A <emph>little</emph> philosophy inclineth a
man's mind to Atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth
men's minds about to religion; for, while the mind of man
looketh upon second causes scattered, it may rest in them,
and go no farther; but when it beholdeth <emph>the chain</emph> of them
confederated and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence
and Deity.</q>

<head>Pantheists.</head>

<p>
Abner Kneeland's <q>Philosophical Creed,</q> as he terms it,
is probably a good definition of the views of those who consider
the universe as an immense animal,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<q>Whose body nature is, and God the soul.</q>
</quote>

<p>
Mr. Kneeland says, <q>I believe in the existence of a
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>
universe of suns and planets, among which there is one sun
belonging to our planetary system, and that other suns, being
more remote, are called stars; but that they are indeed suns
to other planetary systems. I believe that the whole universe
is <hi rend='smallcaps'>nature</hi>, and that
the word <hi rend='smallcaps'>nature</hi> embraces the whole
universe, and that God and Nature, so far as we can attach
any rational idea to either, are perfectly synonymous terms.
Hence I am not an Atheist, but a <hi rend='smallcaps'>Pantheist</hi>; that is, instead
of believing there is no God, I believe that, in the
abstract, all is God; and that all power that is, is in God, and
that there is no power except that which proceeds from God.
I believe that there can be no will or intelligence where there
is no sense, and no sense where there are no organs of
sense; and hence sense, will, and intelligence, is the effect,
and not the cause, of organization. I believe in all that
logically results from those premises, whether good, bad, or
indifferent. Hence I believe that God is all in all; and
that it is in God we live, move, and have our being; and
that the whole duty of man consists in living as long as he
can, and in promoting as much happiness as he can while he
lives.</q>

<head>Mahometans.</head>

<p>
Mahometanism is a scheme of religion formed and propagated
by <hi rend='italic'>Mahomet</hi>, who was born at Mecca, A. D. 569, and
died at Medina, in 632.
</p>

<p>
His system is a compound of Paganism, Judaism, and
Christianity; and the Koran, which is their Bible, is held in
great reverence. It is replete with absurd representations,
and is supposed to have been written by a Jew. The most
eloquent passage is allowed to be the following, where God
is introduced, bidding the waters of the deluge to cease:&mdash;<q>Earth,
swallow up the waters; heaven, draw up those thou
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>
hast poured out; immediately the waters retreated, the command
of God was obeyed, the ark rested on the mountains,
and these words were heard&mdash;<q>Woe to the wicked!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
This religion is still professed and adhered to by the Turks
and Persians, and by several nations in Asia and Africa.
The best statistical writers estimate the number of Mahometans
in the world at about one hundred and forty millions.
</p>

<p>
Mahomet descended from an honorable tribe, and from
the noblest family of that tribe; yet his original lot was poverty.
By his good conduct, he obtained the hand of a widow
of wealth and respectability, and was soon raised to an equality
with the richest people in Mecca.
</p>

<p>
Soon after his marriage, he formed the scheme of establishing
a new religion, or, as he expressed it, of replanting the
only true and ancient one professed by Adam, Noah, Abraham,
Moses, Jesus, and all the prophets, by destroying the
gross idolatry into which most of his countrymen had fallen,
and weeding out the corruptions and superstitions which the
later Jews and Christians had, as he thought, introduced into
their religion, and reducing it to its original purity, which
consisted chiefly in the worship of one God.
</p>

<p>
The Mahometans divide their religion into two general
parts, faith and practice, of which the first is divided into six
distinct branches&mdash;belief in God, in his angels, in his Scriptures,
in his prophets, in the resurrection and final judgment,
and in God's absolute decrees. The points relating to practice
are, prayer, with washings, alms, fasting, pilgrimage to
Mecca, and circumcision.
</p>

<p>
They believe that both Mahomet and those among his followers
who are reckoned orthodox, had, and continue to
have, just and true notions of God, and that his attributes
appear so plain from the Koran itself, and all the Mahometan
divines, that it would be loss of time to refute those who
suppose the God of Mahomet to be different from the true
God, and only a fictitious deity, or idol of his own creation.
</p>

<p>
They believe that the existence of angels, and their purity,
are absolutely required to be believed in the Koran; and he
<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>
is reckoned an infidel who denies there are such beings, or
hates any of them, or asserts any distinction of sexes among
them. They believe them to have pure and subtile bodies,
created of fire; that they neither eat, drink, nor propagate
their species; that they have various forms and offices, some
adoring God in different postures, others singing praises to
him, or interceding for mankind. They hold that some of
them are employed in writing down the actions of men,
others in carrying the throne of God, and other services.
</p>

<p>
As to the Scriptures, the Mahometans are taught by the
Koran, that God, in divers ages of the world, gave revelations
of his will in writing to several prophets, the whole and every
one of which it is absolutely necessary for a good Moslem to
believe. The number of these sacred books were, according
to them, one hundred and four; of which ten were given to
Adam, fifty to Seth, thirty to Edris or Enoch, ten to Abraham,
and the other four, being the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the
Gospel, and the Koran, were successively delivered to Moses,
David, Jesus, and Mahomet; which last being the seal of the
prophets, those revelations are now closed, and no more are
to be expected. All these divine books, except the four last,
they agree now to be entirely lost, and their contents unknown,
though the Sabians have several books which they attribute
to some of the antediluvian prophets. And of those four, the
Pentateuch, Psalms, and Gospel, they say, have undergone
so many alterations and corruptions, that, though there may
possibly be some part of the true word of God therein, yet no
credit is to be given to the present copies in the hands of the
Jews and Christians.
</p>

<p>
They believe that the number of the prophets which have
been from time to time sent by God into the world, amounts
to no less than 224,000, according to one Mahometan tradition;
or to 124,000, according to another; among whom 313
were apostles, sent with special commissions to reclaim mankind
from infidelity and superstition; and six of them brought
new laws or dispensations, which successively abrogated the
preceding: these were Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus,
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>
and Mahomet. All the prophets in general the Mahometans
believe to have been freed from great sins and errors of consequence,
and professors of one and the same religion, that
is, Islamism, notwithstanding the different laws and institutions
which they observed. They allow of degrees among
them, and hold some of them to be more excellent and honorable
than others. The first place they give to the revealers
and establishes of new dispensations, and the next to the
apostles.
</p>

<p>
They believe in a general resurrection and a future judgment.
</p>

<p>
The time of the resurrection the Mahometans allow to be
a perfect secret to all but God alone; the angel Gabriel himself
acknowledging his ignorance in this point, when Mahomet
asked him about it. However, they say the approach of
that day may be known from certain signs which are to precede
it.
</p>

<p>
After the examination is past, and every one's work weighed
in a just balance, they say that mutual retaliation will follow,
according to which every creature will take vengeance one
of another, or have satisfaction made them for the injuries
which they have suffered. And, since there will then be no
other way of returning like for like, the manner of giving
this satisfaction will be by taking away a proportional part of
the good works of him who offered the injury, and adding it
to those of him who suffered it; which being done, if the
angels (by whose ministry this is to be performed) say, <q><hi rend='italic'>Lord
we have given to every one his due, and there remaineth of
this person's good works so much as equalleth the weight of an
ant,</hi></q> God will, of his mercy, cause it to be doubled unto him,
that he may be admitted into paradise; but if, on the contrary,
his good works be exhausted, and there remain evil
works only, and there be any who have not yet received satisfaction
from him, God will order that an equal weight of
their sins be added unto his, that he may be punished for
them in their stead, and he will be sent to hell laden with
both. This will be the method of God's dealing with mankind.
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
As to brutes, after they shall have likewise taken
vengeance of one another, he will command them to be
changed into dust; wicked men being reserved to more
grievous punishment, so that they shall cry out, on hearing
this sentence passed on the brutes, <q><hi rend='italic'>Would to God that we
were dust also!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
The trials being over, and the assembly dissolved, the Manometans
hold that those who are to be admitted into paradise
will take the right hand way, and those who are destined
into hell-fire will take the left; but both of them must first
pass the bridge called in Arabic <foreign lang='ar' rend='italic'>al
Sirat</foreign>, which, they say, is
laid over the midst of hell, and described to be finer than a
hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword; so that it seems
very difficult to conceive how any one shall be able to stand
upon it; for which reason most of the sect of the Motazalites
reject it as a fable; though the orthodox think it a sufficient
proof of the truth of this article, that it was seriously affirmed
by him who never asserted a falsehood, meaning their prophet,
who, to add to the difficulty of the passage, has likewise declared
that this bridge is beset on each side with briers and
hooked thorns, which will, however, be no impediment to the
good; for they shall pass with wonderful ease and swiftness,
like lightning, or the wind, Mahomet, and his Moslems leading
the way; whereas the wicked, what with the slipperiness
and extreme narrowness of the path, the entangling of the
thorns, and the extinction of the light which directed the
former to paradise, will soon miss their footing, and fall down
headlong into hell, which is gaping beneath them.
</p>

<p>
As to the punishment of the wicked, the Mahometans are
taught that hell is divided into seven stories or apartments,
one below another, designed for the reception of as many
distinct classes of the damned.
</p>

<p>
The first, which they call <hi rend='italic'>Jehenan</hi>, they say, will be the
receptacle of those who acknowledged one God, that is, the
wicked Mahometans; who, after having been punished according
to their demerits, will at length be released; the
second, named <hi rend='italic'>Ladha</hi>, they assign to the Jews; the third,
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>
named <hi rend='italic'>al Hotama</hi>, to
the Christians; the fourth, named <hi rend='italic'>al
Sair</hi>, to the Sabians; the fifth; named <hi rend='italic'>Sakar</hi>, to the Magians;
the sixth, named <hi rend='italic'>al Jahin</hi>, to the idolaters; and the
seventh, which is the lowest and worst of all, and is called <hi rend='italic'>al
Howyat</hi>, to the hypocrites, or those who outwardly professed
some religion, but in their hearts were of none. Over each
of these apartments they believe there will be set a guard of
angels, nineteen in number; to whom the damned will confess
the just judgment of God, and beg them to intercede
with him for some alleviation of their pain, or that they may
be delivered by being annihilated.
</p>

<p>
Mahomet has, in his Koran and traditions, been very exact
in describing the various torments of hell, which, according
to him, the wicked will suffer, both from intense heat and
excessive cold. The degrees of these pains will also vary in
proportion to the crimes of the sufferer, and the apartment
he is condemned to; and he who is punished the most
lightly of all will be shod with shoes of fire, the fervor of
which will cause his skull to boil like a caldron. The condition
of these unhappy wretches, as the same prophet teaches,
cannot be properly called either <emph>life</emph> or <emph>death</emph>; and their misery
will be greatly increased by their despair of being ever
delivered from that place, since, according to that frequent expression
in the Koran, <hi rend='italic'>they must remain therein forever</hi>. It
must be remarked, however, that the infidels alone will be liable
to eternity of damnation; for the Moslems, or those who have
embraced the true religion, and have been guilty of heinous
sins, will be delivered thence after they shall have expiated
their crimes by their sufferings. The time which these believers
shall be detained there, according to a tradition handed
down from their prophet, will not be less than nine hundred
years, nor more than seven thousand. And, as to the manner
of their delivery, they say that they shall be distinguished by
the marks of prostration on those parts of their bodies with
which they used to touch the ground in prayer, and over
which the fire will therefore have no power; and that, being
known by this characteristic, they will be released by the
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>
mercy of God, at the intercession of Mahomet and the blessed
whereupon those who shall have been dead will be restored
to life, as has been said; and those whose bodies shall have
contracted any sootiness or filth, from the flames and smoke
of hell, will be immersed in one of the rivers of paradise,
called the <hi rend='italic'>River of Life</hi>, which will wash them whiter than
pearls.
</p>

<p>
The righteous, as the Mahometans are taught to believe,
having surmounted the difficulties, and passed the sharp
bridge above mentioned, before they enter paradise, will be
refreshed by drinking at the <hi rend='italic'>Pond</hi> of their prophet, who describes
it to be an exact square, of a month's journey in compass;
its water, which is supplied by two pipes from al Cawthay,
one of the rivers of paradise, being whiter than milk or
silver, and more odoriferous than musk, with as many cups
set round it as there are stars in the firmament; of which
water whoever drinks will thirst no more forever. This is
the first taste which the blessed will have of their future and
now near-approaching felicity.
</p>

<p>
Though paradise be so very frequently mentioned in the
Koran, yet it is a dispute among the Mahometans, whether it
be already created, or to be created hereafter; the Motazalites
and some other sectaries asserting that there is not at present
any such place in nature, and that the paradise which the
righteous will inhabit in the next life will be different from
that from which Adam was expelled. However, the orthodox
profess the contrary, maintaining that it was created even
before the world, and describe it from their prophet's traditions
in the following manner:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
They say it is situated in the seventh heaven, and next
under the throne of God; and, to express the amenity of the
place, tell us that the earth of it is of the finest wheat-flour,
or of the purest mask, or, as others will have it, of saffron;
that its stones are pearls and jacinths, the walls of its building
enriched with gold and silver, and that the trunks of all its
trees are of gold; among which the most remarkable is the
tree called <hi rend='italic'>tuba</hi>, or the tree of happiness. Concerning this
<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>
tree, they fable that it stands in the palace of Mahomet
though a branch of it will reach to the house of every true
believer; that it will be laden with pomegranates, grapes,
dates, and other fruits of surprising bigness, and of tastes
unknown to mortals; so that, if a man desire to eat of any
particular kind of fruit, it will immediately be presented him;
or, if he choose flesh, birds ready dressed will be set before
him, according to his wish. They add that the boughs of this
tree will spontaneously bend down to the hand of the person
who would gather of its fruits, and that it will supply the
blessed not only with food, but also with silken garments, and
beasts to ride on ready saddled and bridled, and adorned with
rich trappings, which will burst forth from its fruits; and that
this tree is so large, that a person mounted on the fleetest
horse, would not be able to gallop from one end of its shade
to the other in one hundred years.
</p>

<p>
As plenty of water is one of the greatest additions to the
pleasantness of any place, the Koran often speaks of the rivers
of paradise as a principal ornament thereof: some of
these rivers, they say, flow with water, some with milk, some
with wine, and others with honey; all taking their rise from
the root of the tree tuba.
</p>

<p>
But all these glories will be eclipsed by the resplendent and
ravishing girls of paradise, called, from their large black
eyes, <foreign lang='ar' rend='italic'>Hur al oyun</foreign>,
the enjoyment of whose company will
be a principal felicity of the faithful. These, they say, are
created, not of clay, as mortal women are, but of pure musk;
being, as their prophet often affirms in his Koran, free from
all natural impurities, of the strictest modesty, and secluded
from public view in pavilions of hollow pearls, so large that,
as some traditions have it, one of them will be no less than
sixty miles square.
</p>

<p>
The name which the Mahometans usually give to this happy
mansion is <foreign lang='ar' rend='italic'>al
Jannat</foreign>, or <q>the Garden;</q> and sometimes
they call it the <q>Garden of Paradise,</q> the <q>Garden of
Eden,</q> the <q>Garden of Abode,</q> the <q>Garden of Pleasure,</q>
and the like; by which several appellations some understand
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>
so many different gardens, or at least places of
different degrees of felicity, (for they reckon no less than one
hundred such in all,) the very meanest whereof will afford
its inhabitants so many pleasures and delights, that one would
conclude they must even sink under them, had not Mahomet
declared that, in order to qualify the blessed for a full enjoyment
of them, God will give to every one the abilities of one
hundred men.
</p>

<p>
The orthodox doctrine is, that whatever hath or shall come
to pass in this world, whether it be good or whether it be
bad, proceedeth entirely from the divine will, and is irrevocably
fixed and recorded from all eternity in the preserved
table; God having secretly predetermined not only the adverse
and prosperous fortune of every person in this world,
in the most minute particulars, but also his faith or infidelity,
his obedience or disobedience, and consequently his everlasting
happiness or misery after death; which fate or predestination
it is not possible by any foresight or wisdom to
avoid.
</p>

<p>
The pilgrimage to Mecca is so necessary a point of practice,
that, according to a tradition of Mahomet, he who dies
without performing it, may as well die a Jew or a Christian;
and the same is expressly commanded in the Koran.
</p>

<p>
What is principally reverenced in Mecca, and gives sanctity
to the whole, is a square stone building, called the <hi rend='italic'>Caaba</hi>.
Before the time of Mahomet, this temple was a place of
worship for the idolatrous Arabs, and is said to have contained
no less than three hundred and sixty different images, equalling
in number the days of the Arabian year. They were all
destroyed by Mahomet, who sanctified the Caaba, and appointed
it to be the chief place of worship for all true believers.
The Mussulmen pay so great a veneration to it, that
they believe a single sight of its sacred walls, without any
particular act of devotion, is as meritorious in the sight of
God as the most careful discharge of one's duty, for the space
of a whole year, in any other temple.
</p>

<p>
The Mahometans have an established priesthood and a
<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>
numerous body of clergymen: their spiritual head, in Turkey,
whose power is not inferior to the Roman Pontiff, or
the Grecian Patriarch, is denominated the <hi rend='italic'>Mufti</hi>, and is regarded
as the oracle of sanctity and wisdom. Their houses
of worship are denominated mosques, many of which are
very magnificent, and very richly endowed. The revenues
of some of the royal mosques are said to amount to the enormous
sum of 60,000 pounds sterling. In the city of Fez,
the capital of the emperor of Morocco, there are near one
thousand mosques, fifty of which are built in a most magnificent
style, supported by marble pillars. The circumference
of the grand mosque is near a mile and a half, in which near
a thousand lamps are lighted every night. The Mahometan
priests, who perform the rites of their public worship, are
called <hi rend='italic'>Imams</hi>; and
they have a set of ministers called <hi rend='italic'>Sheiks</hi>,
who preach every <hi rend='italic'>Friday</hi>, the Mahometan Sabbath, much in
the manner of Christian preachers. They seldom touch
upon points of controversy in their discourses, but preach
upon moral duties, upon the dogmas and ceremonies of their
religion, and declaim against vice, luxury, and corruption of
manners.
</p>

<p>
The rapid success which attended the propagation of this
new religion was owing to causes that are plain and evident,
and must remove, or rather prevent, our surprise, when they
are attentively considered. The terror of Mahomet's arms,
and the repeated victories which were gained by him and his
successors, were, no doubt, the irresistible arguments that
persuaded such multitudes to embrace his religion, and submit
to his dominion. Besides, his law was artfully and marvellously
adapted to the corrupt nature of man, and, in a
most particular manner, to the manners and opinions of the
Eastern nations, and the vices to which they were naturally
addicted; for the articles of faith which it proposed were
few in number, and extremely simple; and the duties it required
were neither many nor difficult, nor such as were
incompatible with the empire of appetites and passions. It is
to be observed, further, that the gross ignorance under which
<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>
the Arabians, Syrians, Persians, and the greatest part, of the
Eastern nations, labored at this time, rendered many an easy
prey to the artifice and eloquence of this bold adventurer.
To these causes of the progress of Mahometanism we may
add the bitter dissensions and cruel animosities that reigned
among the Christian sects&mdash;dissensions that filled a great
part of the East with carnage, assassinations, and such detestable
enormities as rendered the very name of Christianity
odious to many. Other causes of the sudden progress of that
religion will naturally occur to such as consider attentively
its spirit and genius, and the state of the world at this time.
</p>

<p>
To show the subtlety of Mahomet's mind, and the extreme
ignorance of his followers, we give the story of that
impostor's night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and from
thence to heaven.
</p>

<p>
The story, as related in the Koran, and believed by the
Mahometans, is this: <q rend='pre'>At night, as he lay in his bed, with
his best beloved wife Ayesha, he heard a knocking at his
door; upon which, arising, he found there the angel Gabriel,
with seventy pair of wings, expanded from his sides, whiter
than snow, and clearer than crystal, and the beast Alborak
standing by him; which, they say, is the beast on which the
prophets used to ride, when they were carried from one place
to another, upon the execution of any divine command. Mahomet
describes it to be a beast as white as milk, and of a
mixed nature, between an ass and a mule, and also of a size
between both; but of such extraordinary swiftness as to
equal even lightning itself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As soon as Mahomet appeared at the door, the angel Gabriel
kindly embraced him, saluted him in the name of God,
and told him that he was sent to bring him unto God, into
heaven, where he should see strange mysteries, which were
not lawful to be seen by any other man. He prayed him,
then, to get upon Alborak; but the beast, having lain idle and
unemployed from the time of Christ to Mahomet, was grown
so mettlesome and skittish, that he would not stand still for
Mahomet to mount him, till at length he was forced to bribe
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
him to it by promising him a place in paradise. When he
was firmly seated on him, the angel Gabriel led the way, with
the bridle of the beast in his hand, and carried the prophet
from Mecca to Jerusalem in the twinkling of an eye. On
his coming thither, all the departed prophets and saints appeared
at the gate of the temple to salute him, and, thence
attending him into the chief oratory, desired him to pray for
them, and then withdrew. After this, Mahomet went out
of the temple with the angel Gabriel, and found a ladder of
light, ready fixed for them, which they immediately ascended,
leaving Alborak tied to a rock till their return.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>On their arrival at the first heaven, the angel knocked at
the gate; and, informing the porter who he was, and that he
had brought Mahomet, the friend of God, he was immediately
admitted. This first heaven, he tells us, was all of pure silver;
from whence he saw the stars hanging from it by chains
of gold, each as big as Mount Noho, near Mecca, in Arabia.
On his entrance, he met a decrepit old man, who, it seems,
was our first father, Adam; and, as he advanced, he saw a
multitude of angels in all manner of shapes&mdash;in the shape of
birds, beasts, and men. We must not forget to observe that
Adam had the piety immediately to embrace the prophet,
giving God thanks for so great a son, and then recommended
himself to his prayers. From this first heaven he tells us
that he ascended into the second, which was at the distance
of five hundred years' journey above it, and this he makes to
be the distance of every one of the seven heavens, each above
the other. Here the gates being opened to him as before, at
his entrance he met Noah, who, rejoicing much at the sight
of him, recommended himself to his prayers. This heaven
was all of pure gold, and there were twice as many angels in
it as in the former; for he tells us that the number of angels
in every heaven increased as he advanced. From this second
heaven he ascended into the third, which was made of precious
stones, where he met Abraham, who also recommended
himself to his prayers; Joseph, the son of Jacob, did the
same in the fourth heaven, which was all of emerald; Moses
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>
in the fifth, which was all of adamant; and John the Baptist
in the sixth, which was all of carbuncle; whence he ascended
into the seventh, which was of divine light; and here he found
Jesus Christ. However, it is observed that here he alters
his style; for he does not say that Jesus Christ recommended
himself to his prayers, but that he recommended himself to
the prayers of Jesus Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The angel Gabriel, having brought him thus far, told him
that he was not permitted to attend him any farther, and
therefore directed him to ascend the rest of the way to the
throne of God by himself. This he performed with great
difficulty, passing through rough and dangerous places, till
he came where he heard a voice saying unto him, <q>O Mahomet,
salute thy Creator;</q> whence ascending higher, he
came into a place where he saw a vast expansion of light, so
exceedingly bright, that his eyes could not bear it. This, it
seems, was the habitation of the Almighty, where his throne
was placed; on the right side of which, he says, God's name
and his own were written in these Arabic words: <q>La ellah
ellallah Mahomet reful ollah;</q> that is, <q><hi rend='smallcaps'>There is no God
but God, and Mahomet is his prophet</hi>,</q> which is at this
day the creed of the Mahometans. Being approached to the
divine presence, he tells us that God entered into a familiar
converse with him, revealed to him many hidden mysteries,
made him understand the whole of his law, gave him many
things in charge concerning his instructing men in the
knowledge of it, and, in conclusion, bestowed on him several
privileges above the rest of mankind. He then returned, and
found the angel Gabriel waiting for him in the place where
he left him. The angel led him back along the seven heavens,
through which he had brought him, and set him again
upon the beast Alborak, which stood tied to the rock near
Jerusalem. Then he conducted him back to Mecca, in the
same manner as he brought him thence; and all this within
the space of the tenth part of one night.</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
Dr. Joseph White thus concludes one of his discourses on
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
Mahometanism: <q>What raises Christ and his religion far
above all the fictions of Mahomet, is that awful alternative
of hopes and fears, that looking-for of judgment, which our
Christian faith sets before us. At that day, when time, the
great arbiter of truth and falsehood, shall bring to pass the
accomplishment of the ages, and the Son of God shall make
his enemies his footstool,&mdash;then shall the deluded followers of
the great Impostor, disappointed of the expected intercession
of their prophet, stand trembling and dismayed at the approach
of the glorified Messiah. Then shall they say, <q>Yonder
cometh in the clouds that Jesus whose religion we labored to
destroy; whose temples we profaned; whose servants and
followers we cruelly oppressed! Behold, he cometh, but no
longer the humble son of Mary; no longer a mere mortal
prophet, the equal of Abraham, and of Moses, as that deceiver
taught us, but the everlasting Son of the everlasting Father;
the Judge of mankind; the Sovereign of angels; the Lord of
all things, both in earth and in heaven!</q></q>

<head>Simonians.</head>

<p>
An infidel sect, organized in France, some years since,
whose fundamental principle is, that religion is to perfect the
social condition of man; therefore Christianity is no longer
suitable for society, because it separates the Christian from
other men, and leads him to live for another world. The
world requires a religion that shall be of this world, and,
consequently, a God of this world. They reject whatever
they suppose to have been derived from the philosophy of the
East; they consider the Deity neither as spirit nor matter,
but as including the whole universe, and are thus plainly
Pantheists; and they regard evil as nothing more than an indication
of the progress which mankind are doomed make,
in order to be freed from it; in itself, they maintain it is
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>
nothing. Its members are principally of the higher ranks,
and display, not without success, the greatest activity in
spreading the venom of their infidel principles. They occupy,
in Paris, the largest and most handsomely fitted halls,
where they meet in great numbers.
</p>

<p>
What is very curious in the history of the Simonians is,
that they were, at first, merely philosophers, and not at all
the founders of a religion. They spoke of science and industry,
but not of religious doctrines. All at once, however,
it seemed to occur to them to teach a religion. Then their
school became a church, and their association a sect. It is
evident that, with them, religion was not originally the end
of their institution, but has been employed by them as the
means of collecting a greater number of hearers.

<head>Pagans.</head>

<p>
A general term, applied to heathen idolaters, who worship
false gods, and are not acquainted either with the doctrines
of the Old Testament or the Christian dispensation.
The worship of the Grand Lama is of the most extensive and
splendid character among the Pagan idolaters. This extends
all over Thibet and Mongolia, is almost universal in Bucharia
and several provinces of Tartary; it has followers in Cashmere,
and is the predominant religion of China.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Lama is a name given to the sovereign pontiff,
or high priest, of the Thibetian Tartars, who resides at
Patoli, a vast palace on a mountain, near the banks of
Burhampooter, about seven miles from Lahassa. The foot of
this mountain is inhabited by twenty thousand Lamas, or
priests, who have their separate apartments round about the
mountain, and, according to their respective quality, are
placed nearer or at a greater distance from the sovereign
pontiff. He is not only the sovereign pontiff, the vicegerent
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
of the Deity on earth, but the more remote Tartars are said
to absolutely regard him as the Deity himself, and call him
<hi rend='italic'>God, the everlasting Father of heaven</hi>. They believe him to
be immortal, and endowed with all knowledge and virtue.
Every year they come up, from different parts, to worship,
and make rich offerings at his shrine. Even the emperor of
China, who is a Manchou Tartar, does not fail in acknowledgments
to him, in his religious capacity, and actually entertains,
at a great expense, in the palace of Pekin, an inferior
Lama, deputed as his nuncio from Thibet. The Grand
Lama, it has been said, is never to be seen but in a secret
place of his palace, amidst a great number of lamps, sitting
cross-legged upon a cushion, and decked all over with gold
and precious stones; where, at a distance, the people prostrate
themselves before him, it being not lawful for any so
much as to kiss his feet. He returns not the least sign of
respect, nor ever speaks, even to the greatest princes, but
only lays his hand upon their heads; and they are fully persuaded
they receive from thence a full forgiveness of all
their sins.
</p>

<p>
The magnificence and number of the ancient heathen
temples almost exceed calculation or belief. At one time,
there were no less than 424 temples in the city of Rome,
The temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was accounted one of the
seven wonders of the world. It was 425 feet in length, 220
in breadth, and was adorned with 100 columns 60 feet high;
and, as each column is said to have contained 150 tons of
marble,&mdash;as the stupendous edifice, outside and in, was
adorned with gold, and a profusion of ornaments,&mdash;how immense
must have been the whole expense of its erection!
</p>

<p>
At the present day, many of the pagan nations go to immense
expense in the support of their religious worship. It
is stated, in the Indo-Chinese Gleaner, a paper published by
the missionaries in China, that there are, in that empire,
1056 temples dedicated to Confucius, where above 60,000
animals are annually offered. The followers of Confucius
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>
form one of the smallest of the three leading sects among the
Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ward, a distinguished missionary, was present at the
worship of the goddess Doorga, at Calcutta, in 1806. After
describing the greatness of the assembly, the profusion of the
offerings, and the many strange peculiarities of the worship,
he observes, <q>The whole produced on my mind sensations
of the greatest honor. The dress of the singers, their indecent
gestures, the abominable nature of the songs, the
horrid din of their miserable drum, the lateness of the
hour, the darkness of the place, with the reflection that I
was standing in an idol temple, and that this immense multitude
of rational and immortal creatures, capable of superior
joys, were, in the very act of worship, perpetrating a crime
of high treason against the God of heaven, while they themselves
believed they were performing an act of merit,&mdash;excited
ideas and feelings in my mind which time can never
obliterate.</q>
</p>

<p>
The vast empire of China, misnamed the <hi rend='italic'>Celestial Empire</hi>,
is given up to the vilest idolatry. Idols are encountered at
every step, not merely in the temples, but in the houses, and
even in the vessels, where a part of the forecastle is consecrated
to them, as the most honorable place. The idol is
dressed and adorned with a splendor proportioned to the
wealth of the captain of the vessel, and daily receives an
offering, composed of flesh and fruits, together with the
smoke of perfumes. Besides this regular service, the captain
makes a solemn sacrifice to his wooden deity, on all important
occasions; as, for instance, in passing from one river
into another, or in time of tempest, or when the sails flap idly
in a calm. The Chinese have likewise a practice of deifying
their dead ancestors, and of prostrating themselves before the
monumental tablets which are erected to their memory. Yet
they appear to have no real veneration for any of their idols;
nor do they hesitate to profane the temples, by smoking their
pipes, and taking refreshments, and even by gambling, within
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
the consecrated precincts. The priests are shameless impostors.
They practise the mountebank sciences of astrology,
divination, necromancy, and animal magnetism, and keep for
sale a liquid, which, they pretend, will confer immortality on
those who drink it.

The festival of Juggernaut is annually held on the sea-coast
of Orissa, where there is a celebrated temple, and an idol of
the god. The idol is a carved block of wood, with a frightful
visage, painted black, and a distended mouth of a bloody
color. He is dressed in gorgeous apparel, and his appellation
is one of the numerous names of Vishnu, the preserving
power of the universe, according to the theology of the
Bramins. On festival days, the throne of the idol is placed
upon a stupendous movable tower, about sixty feet in height,
resting on wheels, which indent the ground deeply, as they
turn slowly under the ponderous machine. He is accompanied
by two other idols, his brother Balaram, and his sister
Shubudra, of a white and yellow color, each on a separate
tower, and sitting on thrones of nearly an equal height. Attached
to the principal tower are six ropes, of the length and
size of a ship's cable, by which the people draw it along.
The priests and attendants are stationed around the throne,
on the car, and occasionally address the worshippers in
libidinous songs and gestures. Both the walls of the temple
and sides of the car are covered with the most indecent emblems,
in large and durable sculpture. Obscenity and blood
are the characteristics of the idol's worship. As the tower
moves along, devotees, throwing themselves under the
wheels, are crushed to death; and such acts are hailed
with the acclamations of the multitude, as the most acceptable
sacrifices. A body of prostitutes are maintained in
the temple, for the use of the worshippers; and various other
systematic indecencies, which will not admit of description,
form a part of the service. A number of sacred bulls are
kept in the place, which are generally fed with vegetables
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>
from the hands of the pilgrims, but, from the scarcity of the
vegetation, are commonly seen walking about, and eating the
fresh ordure of the worshipping crowds. In the temple, also,
is preserved a bone of Krishna, which is considered as a
most venerable and precious relic, and which few persons are
allowed to see.

The following is an account of the burning of a Gentoo
woman, on the funeral pile of her deceased husband:&mdash;<q>We
found,</q> says M. Stavorinus, <q rend='pre'>the body of the deceased lying
upon a couch, covered with a piece of white cotton, and
strewed with betel leaves. The woman, who was to be the
victim, sat upon the couch, with her face turned to that of
the deceased. She was richly adorned, and held a little
green branch in her right hand, with which she drove away
the flies from the body. She seemed like one buried in the
most profound meditation, yet betrayed no signs of fear. Many
of her relations attended upon her, who, at stated intervals,
struck up various kinds of music.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The pile was made by driving green bamboo stakes into
the earth, between which was first laid fire-wood, very dry
and combustible; upon this was put a quantity of dry straw,
or reeds, besmeared with grease: this was done alternately,
till the pile was five feet in height; and the whole was then
strewed with rosin, finely powdered. A white cotton sheet,
which had been washed in the Ganges, was then spread over
the pile, and the whole was ready for the reception of the
victim.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The widow was now admonished, by a priest, that it was
time to begin the rites. She was then surrounded by women,
who offered her betel, and besought her to supplicate favors
for them when she joined her husband in the presence of
Ram, or their highest god, and, above all, that she would
salute their deceased friends whom she might meet in the
celestial mansions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In the mean time, the body of the husband was taken
and washed in the river. The woman was also led to the
Ganges for ablution, where she divested herself of all her
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>
ornaments. Her head was covered with a piece of silk, and
a cloth was tied round her body, in which the priests put
some parched rice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She then took a farewell of her friends, and was conducted
by two of her female relations to the pile. When she
came to it, she scattered flowers and parched rice upon the
spectators, and put some into the mouth of the corpse. Two
priests next led her three times round it, while she threw rice
among the bystanders, who gathered it up with great eagerness.
The last time she went round, she placed a little earthen
burning lamp to each of the four corners of the pile,
then laid herself down on the right side, next to the body,
which she embraced with both her arms; a piece of white
cotton was spread over them both; they were bound together
with two easy bandages, and a quantity of fire-wood, straw,
and rosin, was laid upon them. In the last place, her nearest
relations, to whom, on the banks of the river, she had
given her nose-jewels, came with a burning torch, and set
the straw on fire, and in a moment the whole was in a flame.
The noise of the drums, and the shouts of the spectators,
were such that the shrieks of the unfortunate woman, if she
uttered any, could not have been heard.</q>
</p>

<p>
Instances are related of women eighty years of age, or upwards,
perishing in this manner. One case is mentioned,
by Mr. Ward, of a Bramin who had married upwards of a
hundred wives, thirty-seven of whom were burnt with him.
The pile was kept burning for <emph>three days</emph>, and when one or
more of them arrived, they threw themselves into the <emph>blazing
fire</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The Pagans worship an immense variety of idols, both animate
and inanimate, and very frequently make to themselves
gods of objects that are contemptible even among brutes. In
Hindoo, the <hi rend='italic'>monkey</hi> is a celebrated god. A few years since,
the rajah of Nudeeya expended $50,000 in celebrating the
marriage of a pair of those mischievous creatures, with all
the parade and solemnity of a Hindoo wedding.
</p>

<p>
A Bramin of superior understanding gave Mr. Ward
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>
the following <hi rend='italic'>confession of faith</hi>, as the present belief of the
philosophical Hindoos, concerning the nature of God, viz.:&mdash;<q rend='pre'>God
is invisible, independent, ever-living, glorious, uncorrupt,
all-wise, the ever-blessed, the almighty; his perfections
are indescribable and past finding out; he rules over
all, supports all, destroys all, and remains after the destruction
of all; there is none like him; he is silence; he is free
from passion, from birth, &amp;c., and from increase and
decrease, from fatigue, the need of refreshment, &amp;c. He
possesses the power of infinite diminution and lightness, and
is the soul of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He created, and then entered into, all things, in which
he exists in two ways, untouched by matter, and receiving
the fruits of practice. He now assumes visible forms for the
sake of engaging the minds of mankind. The different gods
are parts of God, though his essence remains undiminished,
as rays of light leave the sun his undiminished splendor. He
created the gods to perform those things in the government
of the world, of which man was incapable. Some gods are
parts of other gods, and there are deities of still inferior powers.
If it be asked why God himself does not govern the
world, the answer is, that it might subject him to exposure,
and he chooses to be concealed: he therefore governs by the
gods, who are emanations from the one God, possessing a
portion of his power: he who worships the gods as the one
God, substantially worships God. The gods are helpful to
men in all human affairs, but they are not friendly to those
who seek final absorption, being jealous lest, instead of attaining
absorption, they should become gods, and rival them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Religious ceremonies procure a fund of merit to the
performer, which raises him in every future birth, and at
length advances him to heaven, where he enjoys happiness
for a limited period, or carries him towards final absorption.
A person may sink to earth again by crimes committed in
heaven. The joys of heaven arise only from the gratification
of the senses. A person raised to heaven is considered as
a god.</q>

<q rend='pre'>When the following lines of Pope were read to a learned
Bramin, he started from his seat, begged a copy of them,
and declared the author must have been a Hindoo:&mdash;</q>

Considerable attempts have been made, of late years, for
the enlightening of the heathen; and there is every reason to
believe good has been done. From the aspect of Scripture
prophecy, we are led to expect that the kingdoms of the
heathen at large shall be brought to the light of the gospel.
(Matt. 24:14, Isa. 60, Ps. 22:28, 29; 2:7, 8.) It has been
much disputed whether it be possible that the heathen should
be saved without the knowledge of the gospel; some have
absolutely denied it, upon the authority of those texts which
universally require faith in Christ; but to this it is answered,
that those texts regard only such to whom the gospel comes,
and are capable of understanding the contents of it. <q>The
truth,</q> says Dr. Doddridge, <q>seems to be this&mdash;that
none of the heathen will be condemned for not believing the
gospel, but they are liable to condemnation for the breach of
God's natural law: nevertheless, if there be any of them in
whom there is a prevailing love to the Divine Being, there
seems reason to believe that, for the <emph>sake</emph> of Christ, though to
them unknown, they may be accepted by God; and so much
the rather, as the ancient Jews, and even the apostles, during
the time of our Savior's abode on earth, seem to have had
<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>
but little notion of those doctrines, which those who deny
the salvability of the heathen are most apt to imagine.</q>
(Rom. 2:10-22, Acts 10:34, 35. Matt. 8:11, 12.) Grove,
Watts, Saurin, and the immortal Newton, favor the same
opinion; the latter of whom thus observes: <q>If we suppose a
heathen brought to a sense of his misery; to a conviction
that he cannot be happy without the favor of the great Lord
of the world; to a feeling of guilt, and desire of mercy; and
that, though he has no explicit knowledge of a Savior, he
directs the cry of his heart to the unknown Supreme, to have
mercy upon him,&mdash;who will prove that such views and desires
can arise in the heart of a sinner, without the energy of that
Spirit which Jesus is exalted to bestow? Who will take
upon him to say that his blood has not sufficient efficacy to
redeem to God a sinner who is thus disposed, though he have
never heard of his name? Or who has a warrant to affirm
that the supposition I have made is in the nature of things
impossible to be realized?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That there exist beings, one or many, powerful above
the human race, is a proposition,</q> says Lord Kaimes, <q>universally
admitted as true in all ages and among all nations. I
boldly call it <emph>universal</emph>, notwithstanding what is reported of
some gross savages; for reports that contradict what is acknowledged
to be general among men, require able vouchers.
Among many savage tribes there are no words but for objects
of external sense: is it surprising that such people are incapable
of expressing their religious perceptions, or any perception
of internal sense? The conviction that men have of superior
powers, in every country where there are words to express
it, is so well vouched, that, in fair reasoning, it ought to be
taken for granted among the few tribes where language is
deficient.</q> The same ingenious author shows, with great
strength of reasoning, that the operations of nature and the
government of this world, which to us loudly proclaim the
existence of a Deity, are not sufficient to account for the
universal belief of superior beings among savage tribes. He
is, therefore, of opinion that this universality of conviction
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>
can spring only from the image of Deity stamped upon the
mind of every human being, the ignorant equally with the
learned. This, he thinks, may be termed the <hi rend='italic'>sense of Deity</hi>.

<head>Epicureans.</head>

<p>
The disciples of Epicurus, who flourished about A. M.
3700. This sect maintained that the world was formed not
by God, nor with any design, but by the fortuitous concourse
of atoms. They denied that God governs the world, or in the
least condescends to interfere with creatures below; they
denied the immortality of the soul, and the existence of angels;
they maintained that happiness consisted in pleasure;
but some of them placed this pleasure in the tranquillity and
joy of the mind, arising from the practice of moral virtue, and
which is thought by some to have been the true principle of
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>
Epicurus: others understood him in the gross sense, and
placed all their happiness in corporeal pleasure. When Paul
was at Athens, he had conferences with the Epicurean philosophers.

The word <hi rend='italic'>Skeptic</hi> properly signifies considerative and

or the other, without ever deciding between them. The word
is applied to an ancient sect of philosophers founded by Pyrrho,
who denied the real existence of all qualities in bodies, except
those which are essential to primary atoms, and referred
every thing else to the perceptions of the mind produced by
external objects; in other words, to appearance and opinion.
In modern times, the word has been applied to Deists, or those
who doubt of the truth and authenticity of the sacred Scriptures.

<head>Wickliffites.</head>

<p>
The followers of the famous John Wickliffe, called <q>the
first reformer,</q> who was born in Yorkshire, in the year 1324.
He attacked the jurisdiction of the pope and the bishops.
He was for this twice summoned to a council at Lambeth, to
give an account of his doctrines, but, being countenanced
by the duke of Lancaster, was both times dismissed without
condemnation. Wickliffe, therefore, continued to spread his
new principles, as usual, adding to them doctrines still more
alarming; by which he drew after him a great number of
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>
disciples. Upon this, William Courtney, archbishop of Canterbury,
called another council in 1382, which condemned
24 propositions of Wickliffe and his disciples, and obtained a
declaration of Richard II. against all who should preach
them; but while these proceedings were agitating, Wickliffe
died at Lutterworth, leaving many works behind him for the
establishment of his doctrines. He was buried in his own
church, at Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, where his bones
were suffered to rest in peace till the year 1428, when, by
an order from the pope, they were taken up and burnt.
Wickliffe was doubtless a very extraordinary man, considering
the times in which he lived. He discovered the absurdities
and impositions of the church of Rome, and had
the honesty and resolution to promulgate his opinions, which
a little more support would probably have enabled him to
establish: they were evidently the foundation of the subsequent
reformation.

while the Jews, Saracens, and unworthy Christians, were to
obtain salvation through the Holy Spirit which dwelt in her,

<head>Non-Resistants.</head>

<p>
This is a name assumed by those who believe in the inviolability
of human life, and whose motto is, <hi rend='smallcaps'>Resist not Evil</hi>,&mdash;that
is, by the use of carnal weapons or brute force. They
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>
cannot properly be called a religious sect, in the common
acceptation of that term, and they repudiate the title; for they
differ very widely among themselves in their religious speculations,
and have no forms, ordinances, creed, church, or
community. Some of them belong to almost every religious
persuasion, while others refuse to be connected with any
denomination, and to be called by any sectarian name. Like
the friends of negro emancipation, or of total abstinence from
all intoxicating substances, their eyes are fastened upon a
common object, and their hearts united together by a common
principle; and whatever calls for the violation of that principle,
or for the sacrifice of that object, they feel in duty bound
to reject.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn of 1838, an association was formed in Boston,
called the <q><hi rend='smallcaps'>New England Non-Resistance Society</hi>,</q>
the principles of which are comprehensively imbodied in the
second article of its constitution, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>The members of this society agree in opinion that no man,
or body of men, however constituted, or by whatever name
called, have the right to take the life of man as a penalty for
transgression; that no one, who professes to have the Spirit
of Christ, can consistently sue a man at law for redress of
injuries, or thrust any evil-doer into prison, or fill any office
in which he would come under obligation to execute penal
enactments, or take any part in the military service, or
acknowledge allegiance to any human government, or justify
any man in fighting in defence of property, liberty, life, or
religion; that he cannot engage in or countenance any plot
or effort to revolutionize, or change, by physical violence,
any government, however corrupt or oppressive; that he will
obey <q>the powers that be,</q> except in those cases in which
they bid him violate his conscience&mdash;and then, rather than
to resist, he will meekly submit to the penalty of disobedience;
and that, while he will cheerfully endure all things for
Christ's sake, without cherishing even the desire to inflict
injury upon his persecutors, yet he will be bold and uncompromising
for God, in bearing his testimony against sin, in
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
high places and in low places, until righteousness and peace
shall reign in all the earth, and there shall be none to molest
or make afraid.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the same occasion, a <hi rend='smallcaps'>Declaration of Sentiments</hi>
was adopted, in which the views of Non-Resistants are set
forth in the following positive and argumentative form:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We cannot acknowledge allegiance to any human government;
neither can we oppose any such government by a
resort to physical force. We recognize but one <hi rend='smallcaps'>King</hi> and
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Lawgiver</hi>, one
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Judge</hi> and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Ruler</hi> of mankind. We are
bound by the laws of a kingdom which is not of this world;
the subjects of which are forbidden to fight; in which <hi rend='smallcaps'>Mercy</hi>
and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Truth</hi> are met together,
and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Righteousness</hi> and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Peace</hi>
have kissed each other; which has no state lines, no national
partitions, no geographical boundaries; in which there is no
distinction of rank, or division of caste, or inequality of sex;
the officers of which are <hi rend='smallcaps'>Peace</hi>,
its exactors <hi rend='smallcaps'>Righteousness</hi>,
its walls <hi rend='smallcaps'>Salvation</hi>,
and its gates <hi rend='smallcaps'>Praise</hi>; and which is
destined to break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Our country is the world, our countrymen are all mankind.
We love the land of our nativity only as we love all other
lands. The interests, rights, liberties of American citizens,
are no more dear to us than are those of the whole human race.
Hence we can allow no appeal to patriotism, to revenge any
national insult or injury. The <hi rend='smallcaps'>Prince of Peace</hi>, under
whose stainless banner we rally, came not to destroy, but to
save, even the worst of enemies. He has left us an example,
that we should follow his steps. <hi rend='smallcaps'>God commendeth his love
toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We conceive that, if a nation has no right to defend itself
against foreign enemies, or to punish its invaders, no individual
possesses that right in his own case. The unit
cannot be of greater importance than the aggregate. If one
man may take life, to obtain or defend his rights, the same
license must necessarily be granted to communities, states,
and nations. If <emph>he</emph> may use a dagger or a pistol, <emph>they</emph> may
<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>
employ cannon, bomb-shells, land and naval forces. The
means of self-preservation must be in proportion to the magnitude
of interests at stake, and the number of lives exposed
to destruction. But if a rapacious and bloodthirsty soldiery,
thronging these shores from abroad, with intent to commit
rapine and destroy life, may not be resisted by the people or
magistracy, then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic
troublers of the public peace, or of private security. No
obligations can rest upon Americans to regard foreigners as
more sacred in their persons than themselves, or to give them
a monopoly of wrong-doing with impunity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The dogma, that all the governments of the world are
approvingly ordained of God, and that <hi rend='smallcaps'>the powers that be</hi>,
in the United States, in Russia, in Turkey, are in accordance
with his will, is not less absurd than impious. It makes the
impartial Author of human freedom and equality unequal
and tyrannical. It cannot be affirmed that <hi rend='smallcaps'>the powers
that be</hi>, in any nation, are actuated by the spirit, or guided
by the example, of Christ, in the treatment of enemies;
therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of God; and,
therefore, their overthrow, by a spiritual regeneration of their
subjects, is inevitable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We register our testimony, not only against all wars,
whether offensive or defensive, but all preparations for war;
against every naval ship, every arsenal, every fortification;
against the militia system and a standing army; against all
military chieftains and soldiers; against all monuments
commemorative of victory over a foreign foe, all trophies
won in battle, all celebrations in honor of military or naval
exploits; against all appropriations for the defence of a nation
by force and arms, on the part of any legislative body;
against every edict of government requiring of its subjects
military service. Hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms,
or to hold a military office.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As every human government is upheld by physical strength,
and its laws are enforced virtually at the point of the bayonet,
we cannot hold any office which imposes upon its incumbent
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>
the obligation to compel men to do right, on pain of imprisonment
or death. We therefore voluntarily exclude ourselves
from every legislative and judicial body, and repudiate all
human politics, worldly honors, and stations of authority. If
<emph>we</emph> cannot occupy a seat in the legislature, or on the bench,
neither can we elect <emph>others</emph> to act as our substitutes in any
such capacity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It follows that we cannot sue any man at law, to compel
him by force to restore any thing which he may have wrongfully
taken from us or others; but, if he has seized our coat,
we shall surrender up our cloak rather than subject him to
punishment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We believe that the penal code of the
old covenant, <hi rend='smallcaps'>An
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</hi>, has been abrogated
by JESUS CHRIST; and that, under the new covenant,
the forgiveness, instead of the punishment, of enemies
has been enjoined upon all his disciples, in all cases whatsoever.
To extort money from enemies, or set them upon a
pillory, or cast them into prison or hang them upon a gallows,
is obviously not to forgive, but to take retribution.
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Vengeance is mine&mdash;I will repay, saith the Lord.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The history of mankind is crowded with evidences proving
that physical coërcion is not adapted to moral regeneration;
that the sinful dispositions of man can be subdued only by
love; that evil can be exterminated from the earth only by
goodness; that it is not safe to rely upon an arm of flesh, upon
man, whose breath is in his nostrils, to preserve us from harm;
that there is great security in being gentle, harmless, long-suffering,
and abundant in mercy; that it is only the meek
who shall inherit the earth, for the violent, who resort to the
sword, are destined to perish with the sword. Hence, as a
measure of sound policy,&mdash;of safety to property, life, and
liberty,&mdash;of public quietude and private enjoyment,&mdash;as
well as on the ground of allegiance to HIM who is <hi rend='smallcaps'>King of
kings</hi> and <hi rend='smallcaps'>Lord of
lords</hi>,&mdash;we cordially adopt the non-resistance
principle; being confident that it provides for all
possible consequences, will insure all things needful to us, is
<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>
armed with omnipotent power, and must ultimately triumph
over every assailing force.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We advocate no Jacobinical doctrines. The spirit of
Jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation, violence, and murder.
It neither fears God nor regards man. <emph>We</emph> would be filled
with the Spirit of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi>. If we abide by our principles, it
is impossible for us to be disorderly, or plot treason, or participate
in any evil work: we shall submit to every ordinance
of man, <hi rend='smallcaps'>for the Lord's sake</hi>; obey all the requirements
of government, except such as we deem contrary to the commands
of the gospel; and in no case resist the operation of
law, except by meekly submitting to the penalty of disobedience.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But while we shall adhere to the doctrine of non-resistance
and passive submission to enemies, we purpose, in a
moral and spiritual sense, to speak and act boldly in the
cause of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>; to assail iniquity in high places and in low
places; to apply our principles to all existing civil, political,
legal, and ecclesiastical institutions; and to hasten the time
when the kingdoms of this world will have become the kingdoms
of our <hi rend='smallcaps'>Lord</hi> and of his
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Christ</hi>, and he shall reign forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It appears to us a self-evident truth, that whatever the
gospel is designed to destroy at any period of the world, being
contrary to it, ought now to be abandoned. If, then, the
time is predicted, when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares,
and spears into pruning-hooks, and men shall not
learn the art of war any more, it follows that all who manufacture,
sell, or wield those deadly weapons, do thus array
themselves against the peaceful dominion of the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Son of God</hi>
on earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having thus frankly stated their principles and purposes,
they proceed to specify the measures they propose to adopt,
in carrying their object into effect, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We expect to prevail through <hi rend='smallcaps'>the foolishness of
preaching</hi>, striving to commend ourselves unto every man's
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
conscience, in the sight of <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>. From the press, we shall
promulgate our sentiments as widely as practicable. We
shall endeavor to secure the coöperation of all persons, of
whatever name or sect. The triumphant progress of the cause
of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Temperance</hi> and of
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Abolition</hi> in our land, through the
instrumentality of benevolent and voluntary associations, encourages
us to combine our own means and efforts for the
promotion of a still greater cause. Hence we shall employ
lecturers, circulate tracts and publications, form societies,
and petition our state and national governments, in relation to
the subject of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Universal Peace</hi>. It will be our leading object
to devise ways and means for effecting a radical change
in the views, feelings and practices of society, respecting the
sinfulness of war and the treatment of enemies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In entering upon the great work before us, we are not
unmindful that, in its prosecution, we may be called to test
our sincerity, even as in a fiery ordeal. It may subject us to
insult, outrage, suffering, yea, even death itself. We anticipate
no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation,
calumny. Tumults may arise against us. The ungodly and
violent, the proud and Pharisaical, the ambitious and tyrannical,
principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high
places, may combine to crush us. So they treated the MESSIAH,
whose example we are humbly striving to imitate. If
we suffer with him, we know that we shall reign with him.
We shall not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.
Our confidence is in the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Lord Almighty</hi>, not in man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Having withdrawn from human protection, what can
sustain us but that faith which overcomes the world? We
shall not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try us, as though some strange thing had happened unto
us, but rejoice, inasmuch as we are partakers of CHRIST'S
sufferings. Wherefore we commit the keeping of our souls
to GOD, in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator. <hi rend='smallcaps'>For every
one that forsakes houses, or brethren, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
for Christ's sake, shall receive a hundred fold, and
shall inherit everlasting life.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
For entertaining these sentiments, they say that they <q>have
been stigmatized as no human government men,</q> and ranked
among disorganizers and anarchists. But they believe that
the gospel requires men to suppress every angry emotion, to
forgive every injury, to revenge none; and they ask, <q>Shall
we forgive as individuals, and retaliate as communities? Shall
we turn the other cheek as individuals, and plunge a dagger
into the heart of our enemy as nations? We might as well
be sober as individuals, and drunk as nations. We might as
well be merciful as individuals, and rob as patriots.</q> They
believe that the forgiveness of enemies, whether foreign or
domestic, is the essence, the chief virtue, the soul of the
gospel; that we should preach our Savior's peace, even if it
brings us to our Savior's cross; that Christians should not
punish, either to amend those who trespass against them, or
to comfort themselves; for they do not amend others by fines
and imprisonments, nor do they need any better comfort than
that of their Savior, who, on the cross, not only prayed, but
apologized for his murderers; that, if the gospel is right in
prescribing pardon, the law is wrong in inflicting punishment;
that, if a Christian reigns, he reigns by love, not by force;
that he cannot smile with frowns, forgive with punishment,
love with hatred, bless with the sword, do good with evil, be
humble with pride, love God and serve Mammon; that moral
power would govern men altogether cheaper and better than
physical; that the destruction of every kingdom that has
heretofore existed, proves that men will not, cannot be governed
by physical force; that the refusal of our Savior to
govern, when he had the power of miracles, was his greatest
miracle; and that his obedience, forgiveness, sufferings, and
death, established the constitution of a government, in which
peace on earth and good-will to men will be maintained by
the God of peace, the Prince of peace, and the Spirit of peace.
They believe that, when Jesus referred his hearers to the law
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>
of retaliation, which law constituted the great fundamental
principle in the Jewish civil government, and when, in express
terms, he repealed that law, he laid the axe at the root of that
government, and virtually repealed or abrogated the whole of
it; for of what force can any civil government be, which
cannot enforce its laws by inflicting evil upon its violators?
When Jesus took from the Jewish civil ruler the right to inflict
punishment, he declared the only civil government, which
God had ever instituted, and recognized as of any rightful
authority, to be null and void forever. They think it will be
admitted, by all who receive the plain declarations of Scripture
as truth, that no man, as an individual, has the right to
render evil for evil, or to enforce even his lawful claims, by
his fist, the club, or the sword. But if a man has no such
right as an individual, he has none as a member of a family,
or as the inhabitant of a town, county, state, or nation; hence
he cannot delegate any such right to others, called legislators,
magistrates, judges, sheriffs, &amp;c. If no man has the right to
retaliate with the fist, or club, or sword, it is equally and
immutably true that he has no right to render evil for evil,
by using laws, or magistrates, or judges, or sheriffs, as the
clubs, or swords, or the instruments of such retaliation.
When men <q>resist evil,</q> either by the use of the club, or of
human law, the principle upon which they act is the same in
both cases; the only difference is in the instruments employed.

<head>Southcotters.</head>

<p>
Dr. Evans gives the following account of the religious
views and opinions of Joanna Southcott, who made considerable
noise in England, towards the close of the last
century:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The mission of this prophetess commenced in the year
1792, and the number of people who have joined with her
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>
from that period to the present time, as believing her to be
divinely inspired, was considerable. It was asserted that she
was the instrument, under the direction of Christ, to announce
the establishment of his kingdom on earth, as a fulfilment of all
the promises in the Scriptures, and of that prayer which he
himself gave to his followers; and more particularly of the
promise made to the woman in the fall, through which the
human race is to be redeemed from all the effects of it in
the end. We are taught by the communication of the Spirit
of truth to her, that the seven days of the creation were
types of the two periods in which the reign of Satan and
of Christ are to be proved and contrasted. Satan was
conditionally to have his reign tried for six thousand years,
shadowed by the six days in which the Lord worked, as
his Spirit has striven with man while under the powers of
darkness; but Satan's reign is to be shortened, for the sake
of the elect, as declared in the gospel; and Satan is to have
a further trial at the expiration of the thousand years, for a
time equal to the number of the days shortened. At the
close of the seven thousand years, the judgment is to take
place, and the whole human race will collectively bring
forward the testimony of the evil they suffered under the
reign of Satan, and of the good they enjoyed under the
spiritual reign of Christ. These two testimonies will be
evidence, before the whole creation of God, that the pride
of Satan was the cause of his rebellion in heaven, and that
he was the root of evil upon earth; and, consequently, when
those two great proofs have been brought forward, that part
of the human race that has fallen under his power, to be
tormented by being in the society of Satan and his angels,
will revolt from him in that great day, will mourn that they
have been deluded, will repent, and the Savior of all will
hold out his hand to them in mercy, and will then prepare a
new earth for them to work righteousness, and prepare them
ultimately to join his saints, who have fought the good fight
in this world, while under the reign of Satan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The mission of Joanna is to be accomplished by a perfect
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
obedience to the Spirit that directs her, and so to be made to
claim the promise of <q>bruising the head of the serpent;</q> and
which promise was made to the woman on her casting the
blame upon Satan, whom she unwittingly obeyed, and thus
man became dead to the knowledge of the good; and so he
blamed his Creator for giving him the woman, who was
pronounced his helpmate for good. To fulfil the attribute
of justice, Christ took upon himself that blame, and assumed
his humanity, to suffer on the cross for it, that he might justly
bring the cross upon Satan, and rid him from the earth, and
then complete the creation of man, so as to be after his own
image. It is declared that <q>the seed of the woman</q> are
those who in faith shall join with her in claiming the promise
made in the fall; and they are to subscribe with their hands
unto the Lord that they do thus join with her, praying for
the destruction of the powers of darkness, and for the establishment
of the kingdom of Christ. Those who thus
come forward in this spiritual war, are to have the seal of
the Lord's protection; and if they remain faithful soldiers,
death and hell shall not have power over them; and these are
to make up the sealed number of one hundred and forty-four
thousand, to stand with the Lamb on Mount Sion. The fall
of Satan's kingdom will be a second deluge over the earth;
so that, from his having brought the human race under his
power, a great part of them will fall with him; for the Lord
will pluck out of his kingdom all that offend and do wickedly.
The voice which announces the coming of the Messiah is
accompanied with judgments, and the nations must be shaken
and brought low before they will lay these things to heart.
When all these things are accomplished, then the desire of
nations will come in glory, so that <q>every eye shall see him,</q>
and he will give his kingdom to his saints.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is represented that in the Bible is recorded every
event by which the Deity will work the ultimate happiness
of the human race, but that the great plan is, for the most
part, represented by types and shadows, and otherwise so
wrapped up in mysteries, as to be inscrutable to human wisdom.
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
As the Lord pronounced that man should become dead
to knowledge if he ate the forbidden fruit, so the Lord must
prove his words true. He therefore selected a peculiar people
as depositaries of the records of that knowledge; and he
appeared among them, and they proved themselves dead to
every knowledge of him, by crucifying him. He will, in
like manner, put the wild olive to the same test; and the
result will be, that he will be now crucified in the spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The mission of Joanna began in 1792, at which time
she had prophecies given her, showing how the whole was
to be accomplished. Among other things, the Lord said he
should visit the surrounding nations with various calamities
for fifteen years, as a warning to <emph>this</emph> land; and that then he
should bring about events here which should more clearly
manifest the truth of her mission, by judgment and otherwise;
so that this should be the happy nation to be the first
redeemed from its troubles, and be the instrument for awakening
the rest of the world to a sense of what is coming upon
all, and for destroying <hi rend='italic'>the Beast</hi>, and those who worship his
image.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Joanna Southcott died of a protracted illness. It Was
given out that she was to be the mother of a <hi rend='italic'>Second Shiloh</hi>.
Presents were accordingly made her for the <hi rend='italic'>Babe</hi>, especially
a superb cradle, with a Hebrew inscription in poetry. But
she expired, and no child appeared on the occasion. A stone

<head>Family Of Love.</head>

<p>
A sect that arose in Holland, in the sixteenth century,
founded by Henry Nicholas, a Westphalian. He maintained
that he had a commission from Heaven to teach men that the
essence of religion consisted in the feelings of divine love;
that all other theological tenets, whether they related to
objects of faith or modes of worship, were of no sort of moment,
and, consequently, that it was a matter of the most
perfect indifference what opinions Christians entertained
concerning the divine nature, provided their hearts burned
with the pure and sacred flame of piety and love.

<head>Hutchinsonians.</head>

<p>
Hutchinsonians, the followers of John Hutchinson, born
in Yorkshire, 1674, and who, in the early part of his life,
served the duke of Somerset in the capacity of steward.
The Hebrew Scriptures, he says, comprise a perfect system
of natural philosophy, theology, and religion. In opposition
to Dr. Woodward's <q>Natural History of the Earth,</q> Mr.
Hutchinson, in 1724, published the first part of his curious
book, called <q>Moses' Principia.</q> Its second part was presented
to the public in 1727, which contains, as he apprehends,
the principles of the Scripture philosophy, which are
a plenum and the air. So high an opinion did he entertain
of the Hebrew language, that he thought the Almighty must
have employed it to communicate every species of knowledge,
and that, accordingly, every species of knowledge is to be
found in the Old Testament. Of his mode of philosophizing,
the following specimen is brought forward to the reader's attention:&mdash;<q>The
air, he supposes, exists in three conditions,&mdash;fire,
light, and spirit;&mdash;the two latter are the finer and
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
grosser parts of the air in motion; from the earth to the sun,
the air is finer and finer, till it becomes pure light near the
confines of the sun, and fire in the orb of the sun, or solar
focus. From the earth towards the circumference of this
system, in which he includes the fixed stars, the air becomes
grosser and grosser, till it becomes stagnant, in which condition
it is at the utmost verge of this system, from whence,
in his opinion, the expression of
<hi rend='italic'>outer darkness</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>blackness
of darkness</hi>, used in the New Testament, seems to be taken.</q>
</p>

<p>
The followers of Mr. Hutchinson are numerous, and
among others the Rev. Mr. Romaine, Lord Duncan Forbes,
of Culloden, and the late amiable Dr. Horne, bishop of
Norwich.

<p>
In a letter dated Nauvoo, Illinois, March 1, 1842, Prophet
Joseph Smith says:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>On the evening of the 21st of September, A. D. 1823,
while I was praying unto God, and endeavoring to exercise
faith in the precious promises of Scripture, on a sudden a light
like that of day, only of a far purer and more glorious appearance
and brightness, burst into the room; indeed, the first sight
was as though the house was filled with consuming fire; the
appearance produced a shock that affected the whole body
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
In a moment, a personage stood before me surrounded with a
glory yet greater than that with which I was already surrounded.
This messenger proclaimed himself to be an angel
of God, sent to bring the joyful tidings, that the covenant
which God made with ancient Israel was at hand to be fulfilled;
that the preparatory work for the second coming of the Messiah
was speedily to commence; that the time was at hand for the
gospel, in all its fulness, to be preached, in power, unto all nations,
that a people might be prepared for the millennial reign.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I was informed that I was chosen to be an instrument in
the hands of God to bring about some of his purposes in this
glorious dispensation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants
of this country, and shown who they were, and from whence
they came; a brief sketch of their origin, progress, civilization,
laws, governments, of their righteousness and iniquity,
and the blessings of God being finally withdrawn from them
as a people, was made known unto me. I was also told where
there were deposited some plates, on which was engraven an
abridgment of the records of the ancient prophets that had
existed on this continent. The angel appeared to me three
times the same night, and unfolded the same things. After
having received many visits from the angels of God, unfolding
the majesty and glory of the events that should transpire in
the last days, on the morning of the 22d of September, A. D
1827, the angel of the Lord delivered the records into my
hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>These records were engraven on plates which had the
appearance of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight
inches long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They
were filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound
together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings
running through the whole. The volume was something near
six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The
characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully
engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity
in its construction, and much skill in the art of engraving.
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>
With the records was found a curious instrument, which
the ancients called <q>Urim and Thummim,</q> which consisted of
two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to a
breastplate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I
translated the record, by the gift and power of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In this important and interesting book the history of
ancient America is unfolded, from its first settlement by a
colony that came from the tower of Babel, at the confusion
of languages, to the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian
era. We are informed by these records that America,
in ancient times, has been inhabited by two distinct races of
people. The first were called Jaredites, and came directly
from the tower of Babel. The second race came directly
from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before
Christ. They were principally Israelites, of the descendants
of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time that
the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in
the inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the
second race fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century.
The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this
country. This book also tells us that our Savior made his
appearance upon this continent after his resurrection, that he
planted the gospel here in all its fulness, and richness, and
power, and blessing; that they had apostles, prophets, pastors,
teachers, and evangelists; the same order, the same
priesthood, the same ordinances, gifts, powers, and blessing,
as were enjoyed on the eastern continent; that the people
were cut off in consequence of their transgressions; that the
last of their prophets who existed among them was commanded
to write an abridgment of their prophecies, history, &amp;c.,
and to hide it up in the earth, and that it should come forth,
and be united with the Bible, for the accomplishment of the
purposes of God in the last days. For a more particular
account, I would refer to the Book of Mormon, which can be
purchased at Nauvoo, or from any of our travelling elders.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>As soon as the news of this discovery was made known,
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>
false reports, misrepresentation, and slander flew, as on the
wings of the wind, in every direction; the house was frequently
beset by mobs and evil-designing persons; several
times I was shot at, and very narrowly escaped, and every
device was made use of to get the plates away from me; but
the power and blessing of God attended me, and several
began to believe my testimony.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the 6th of April, 1830, the <q>Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints</q> was first organized in the town of
Manchester, Ontario county, state of New York. Some few
were called and ordained by the spirit of revelation and
prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance;
and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the
power of God, and many were brought to repentance, were
immersed in the water, and were filled with the Holy Ghost
by the laying on of hands. They saw visions and prophesied:
devils were cast out, and the sick healed by the laying on of
hands. From that time, the work rolled forth with astonishing
rapidity, and churches were soon formed in the states of
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.
In the last-named state, a considerable settlement was

noble, and patriotic citizens to obey its divine mandates, and
be governed by its sacred truths. It has also spread into

calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth
boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>History Of The Ancients Of America, And Also Of
The Book Of Mormon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Six hundred years B. C, according to the Book of
Mormon, Lehi, who was a righteous man, was forewarned of
the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonish captivity,
who was commanded by the Lord, took his family and fled
into the wilderness. He pitched his tent in the wilderness,
near the Red Sea, and sent back his sons to Jerusalem, who
persuaded one Ishmael and his family to accompany them to
their father Lehi. The Lord promised to lead them to a
choice land above all lands; therefore they set out on their
journey for this land. After a long and tedious journey, they
came to the great waters, or the ocean. Nephi, the son of
Lehi, who was also a prophet, and their pilot, or leader, in
the wilderness, was commanded and instructed to build a
ship sufficiently large to transport them over the sea. This
work was accomplished in eight years from the time they left
Jerusalem. They set sail, and in a proper time they landed,
as we infer from their record, somewhere on the western
coast of South America. They immediately commenced
tilling the earth, and erecting mansions for dwelling-places.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Lehi had six sons, Laman, Lemuel, Nephi, Sam, Jacob,
and Joseph. Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, rebelled
against God, and would not keep his commandments;
for this they were cursed. Their posterity, in process of
time, became a powerful nation, but extremely wicked; and
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
their chief occupations were hunting, plundering, and roving
about from place to place. In the Book of Mormon, they
are called Lamanites. The other sons of Lehi were obedient
to the commands of God. Their posterity, also, in the course
of time, became a great nation, and were called Nephites.
To them God committed his divine oracles, (the holy priesthood,)
and they had prophets and inspired men among them.
They also kept a record of their prophecies and revelations,
and the proceedings of their nation. When they left Jerusalem,
they brought with them the law of Moses, and the
writings of the former prophets, down to the days of Jeremiah.
This accounts for the quotations from Isaiah and
others, which are found in the Book of Mormon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Nephites tilled the land, built cities, and erected
temples for places of worship; but the Lamanites lived a
more indolent life, although, in some instances, they built
cities. The Nephites were at times faithful to God; at other
times they were indifferent, and would not be faithful. They
frequently had long and tedious wars with the Lamanites, and
were often driven before them. They were constantly emigrating
to the north. At length they commenced settlements
in the region of country not far from the Isthmus of Darien;
and, while in those parts, they advanced further in science
and arts than at any time previous, and built more spacious
cities and buildings than they did before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Six hundred and thirty odd years from the time Lehi left
Jerusalem, Christ, after his resurrection, appeared unto many
of the Nephites, and established his church, chose disciples,
and sent them throughout the land to preach his gospel, thus
fulfilling the saying, <q>Other sheep I have, which are not of
this fold; them I must go and bring also.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Individuals of the Lamanites, at times, were obedient to
the faith. The Nephites, after Christ's appearance, were
faithful for many years; but, in the third or fourth century,
iniquity began to abound, and their love began to wax cold.
Some dissented, and raised up churches for the sake of gain;
and thus they were troubled with the spirit of pride and
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
haughtiness. God commanded Mormon, who lived in the
fourth century, to preach repentance to them, and foretell
their destruction if they would not repent. The Lord, foreseeing
that they would not repent, commanded Mormon to
collect the writings of his forefathers,&mdash;their revelations and
prophecies, &amp;c.,&mdash;and make an abridgment of them, and
engrave them upon new plates, (their manner of keeping
records was to engrave them on metallic plates.) But in
consequence of their wars, and their flight to the north, to
escape the Lamanites, he did not live to finish this work;
and, when the final destruction of the Nephites drew near, he
gave the records to his son Moroni, who lived to see their
final extermination, or destruction, by the hands of the Lamanites,
and they, with his father, left to moulder on the
plain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Thus a powerful nation, whose fathers were the favorites
of Heaven, were cut off, and their names have faded into
oblivion!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Indians of America are the descendants of the
Lamanites, and, according to predictions that are in the
Book of Mormon, they will yet lay down their weapons of
war, and be converted unto the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Moroni finished compiling and abridging the records of
his fathers, which he engraved upon new plates, for that
purpose, to use his own words, as follows:&mdash;<q>And now,
behold, we have written this record, according to our knowledge,
in the characters which are called among us <hi rend='italic'>the
reformed Egyptian</hi>; being handed down and altered by us,
according to our manner of speech. And, if our plates had
been sufficiently large, we should have written in Hebrew;
but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and, if we
could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no
imperfection in our record. But the Lord knoweth the
things which we have written, and also that none other people
knoweth our language; therefore he hath prepared means
for the interpretation thereof.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He also engraved on them an account, called the <q>Book
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
of Ether</q> of a people who left the old world, and came to this
continent at the time the language was confounded at Babel,
which was a partial fulfilment of the saying, <q>So the Lord
scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the
earth.</q> (Gen. 11:8.)</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Moroni was then commanded to deposit this record in
the earth, together with the <hi rend='italic'>Urim and Thummim</hi>, or, as the
Nephites would have said, <hi rend='italic'>Interpreters</hi>, which were instruments
to assist in the work of the translation, with a promise
from the Lord that it should be brought to light by means of a
Gentile nation that should possess the land, and be published
to the world, and go forth to the Lamanites, and be one of
the instruments in the hands of God for their conversion. It
remained safe in the place where it was deposited, till it was
brought to light by the administration of angels, and translated
by the gift and power of God.</q>

In a volume entitled <q>Doctrine and Covenants,</q> are a

inasmuch as they have families, and receive moneys by gift,
that they should send it unto them, or make use of it for their

good. And let all those who have not families, who receive
moneys, send it up unto the bishop in Zion, or unto the
bishop in Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing
forth of the revelations, and the printing thereof, and for
establishing Zion.</q>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a

rejoicing. And if any man among you be strong in the
Spirit, let him take with him he that is weak, that he may be
edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And the bishop, also, should travel round about and
among all the churches, searching after the poor, to administer
to their wants by humbling the rich and the proud; he
should, also, employ an agent to take charge and to do his
secular business, as he shall direct; nevertheless, let the
bishop go unto the city of New York, and also to the city
of Albany, and also to the city of Boston, and warn the
people of those cities with the sound of the gospel, with a loud
voice, of the desolation and utter abolishment which awaits
them if they do reject these things; for if they do reject
these things, the hour of their judgment is nigh, and their

house shall be left unto them desolate. Let him trust in me,
and he shall not be confounded, and a hair of his head shall
not fall to the ground unnoticed.</q>

<p>
<q>And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, Go
ye forth, as your circumstances shall permit, in your several
callings, unto the great and notable cities and villages, reproving
the world, in righteousness, of all their unrighteous
and ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly
the desolation of abomination in the last days; for with you,
saith the Lord Almighty, I will rend their kingdoms; I will
not only shake the earth, but the starry heavens shall tremble;
for I the Lord have put forth my hand to exert the
powers of heaven: ye cannot see it now; yet a little while
and ye shall see it, and know that I am, and that I will come

Joseph Smith is the son of a farmer, and was born in
Sharon, Vermont, 23d December, 1805. His father removed
to the state of New York about the year 1815, and resided
in Palmyra, and afterwards in Manchester.
</p>

<p>
Smith has many enemies, and his doctrines are warmly
opposed; still, it must be acknowledged that, by his talents,
or the magic influence his scheme of religion has on the
minds of men, or by a union of both, he has acquired an
imposing station in the world. He is styled <hi rend='italic'>Prophet and
High Priest of Jesus Christ, President of the Council of the

Nauvoo, Illinois, formerly Commerce, is situated on the
east side of the Mississippi River, at the head of Des Moines
Rapids, about two hundred and ten miles (by the river) above
St. Louis, thirteen hundred and fifty miles above New Orleans,
and about three hundred miles below Dubuque, in
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>
Iowa. It comprises two miles square of fertile land. The city
of Nauvoo, which was incorporated in 1841, is delightfully
located, on rising ground, near the bank of the river. It
contains many handsome buildings of brick and stone, among
which are the Nauvoo House, a large stone building for the
accommodation of travellers, and the Mormon Temple, likewise
of stone, measuring on the ground one hundred by
one hundred and twenty feet, exclusive of the wings of the
building. This place has one of the best landings on the
river, and its trade is considerable. The number of inhabitants,
at the present time, is about eight thousand, chiefly
Mormons. <hi rend='italic'>Nauvoo</hi> is said

This body of Christians was formed in Kentucky, in 1805,
by the association of a number of ministers and churches of
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>
the Baptist denomination. They differ in no respect from
the regular Baptists, except in the decided stand they have
taken against slavery, in every branch of it, both in principle
and practice, as being a sinful and abominable system, fraught
with peculiar evils and miseries, which every good man ought
to abandon and bear his testimony against. Their desires
and endeavors are, to effect, as soon as it can be done, and
in the most prudent and advantageous manner, both to the
slaves and to their owners, the general and complete emancipation
of this numerous race of enslaved, ignorant, and degraded
beings, who are now, by the laws and customs of the land,
exposed to hereditary and perpetual bondage. (See Exod.

<q>Banish from your land the remains of slavery. Be

Remember, there never was, nor will be, a period when justice
should not be done. Do what is just, and leave the
event with God. Justice is the pillar that upholds the whole
fabric of human society, and mercy is the genial ray which
cheers and warms the habitations of men. The perfection
of our social character consists in properly tempering the
two with one another; in holding that middle course which
admits of our being just without being rigid, and allows us
to be generous without being unjust. May all the citizens
of America be found in the performance of such social duties
as will secure them peace and happiness in this world, and
in the world to come life everlasting!</q>

<head>Perfectionists.</head>

<p>
A modern sect in New England, who believe that every
individual action is either wholly sinful or wholly righteous,
and that every being in the universe, at any given time, is
either entirely holy or entirely wicked. Consequently, they
unblushingly maintain that they themselves are free from
sin. In support of this doctrine, they say that Christ dwells
in and controls believers, and thus secures their perfect holiness;
that the body of Christ, which is the church, is nourished
and guided by the life and wisdom of its Head. Hence
they condemn the greatest portion of the religion in the world
named Christianity, as the work of Antichrist. <q>All the
essential features of Judaism,</q> they say, <q>and of its successor,
Popery, may be distinctly traced in nearly every form of
Protestantism; and although we rejoice in the blessings which
the reformation has given us, we regard it as rightly named
the <hi rend='italic'>reformation</hi>, it being an improvement of Antichrist, not
a restoration of Christianity.</q> This last opinion, which has
some foundation in truth, has been long held, variously modified,
in different parts of the Christian world.
</p>

<p>
An unsuccessful attempt was made to propagate the views
of this sect through the medium of a paper published at New
Haven, Conn., entitled the <hi rend='italic'>Perfectionist</hi>.

<p>
Methodists' Views Of Perfection.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The highest perfection which man can attain, while the
soul dwells in the body, does not exclude ignorance, and error,
and a thousand other infirmities. Now, from wrong
judgments, wrong words and actions will often necessarily
flow; and in some cases, wrong affections, also, may spring
from the same source. I may judge wrong of you; I may
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
think more or less highly of you than I ought to think; and
this mistake in my judgment may not only occasion something
wrong in my behavior, but it may have a still deeper
effect; it may occasion something wrong in my affection.
From a wrong apprehension, I may love and esteem you
either more or less than I ought. Nor can I be freed from a
liableness to such a mistake while I remain in a corruptible
body. A thousand infirmities, in consequence of this, will
attend my spirit, till it returns to God, who gave it; and, in
numberless instances, it comes short of doing the will of God,
as Adam did in paradise. Hence the best of men may say
from the heart,</q>

<q>loving the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his
soul, and with all his mind.</q> This is the sum of Christian
perfection: it is all comprised in that one word, <hi rend='italic'>love</hi>. The
first branch of it is the love of God; and, as he that loves God
loves his brother also, it is inseparably connected with the
second, <q>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;</q> thou
shalt love every man as thy own soul, as Christ loved us.
<q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets:</q> these contain the whole of Christian perfection.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Another view of this is given us in those words of the great
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>
apostle, <q>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ
Jesus.</q> For, although this immediately and directly refers to
the humility of our Lord, yet it may be taken in a far more
extensive sense, so as to include the whole disposition of his
mind, all his affections, all his tempers, both toward God and
man. Now, it is certain that, as there was no evil affection in
him, so no good affection or temper was wanting; so that
<q>whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are lovely,</q>
are all included in <q>the mind that was in Christ Jesus.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>St. Paul, when writing to the Galatians, places perfection
in yet another view. It is the one undivided <hi rend='italic'>fruit of the
Spirit</hi>, which he describes thus: <q>The fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity,
[so the word should be translated here,] meekness, temperance.</q>
What a glorious constellation of grace is here!
Now, suppose all these things to be knit together in one, to
be united together in the soul of a believer,&mdash;this is Christian
perfection.</q>
</p>

<p>
How To Be Sought.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>'But what is that faith whereby we are sanctified, saved
from sin, and perfected in love?' It is a divine evidence
and conviction, first, that God hath promised it in the holy
Scripture. Till we are thoroughly satisfied of this, there is
no moving one step farther. And one would imagine there
needed not one word more to satisfy a reasonable man of this
than the ancient promise, <q>Then will I circumcise thy heart,
and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</q>
How clearly does this express the being perfected in love!&mdash;how
strongly imply the being saved from all sin! For as
long as love takes up the whole heart, what room is there for
sin therein?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is a divine evidence and conviction, secondly, that what
God hath promised he is able to perform. Admitting, therefore,
that <q>with men it is impossible</q> <q>to bring a clean
thing out of an unclean,</q> to purify the heart from all sin, and
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>
to fill it with all holiness,&mdash;yet this creates no difficulty in
the case, seeing <q>with God all things are possible.</q> And
surely no one ever imagined it was possible to any power less
than that of the Almighty! But if God speaks, it shall be
done. God saith, <q>Let there be light; and there [is] light.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It is, thirdly, a divine evidence and conviction that he is
able and willing to do it now. And why not? Is not a moment
to him the same as a thousand years? He cannot want
more time to accomplish whatever is his will. And he cannot
want to stay for any more <emph>worthiness</emph> or <emph>fitness</emph> in the
persons he is pleased to honor. We may, therefore, boldly
say, at any point of time, <q>Now is the day of salvation!</q>
<q>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</q>
<q>Behold, all things are now ready; come unto the marriage.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>To this confidence that God is both able and willing to
sanctify us now, there needs to be added one thing more&mdash;a
divine evidence and conviction that he doeth it. In that
hour it is done: God says to the inmost soul, <q>According to
thy faith be it unto thee.</q> Then the soul is pure from every
spot of sin; it is clean <q>from all unrighteousness.</q> The believer
then experiences the deep meaning of those solemn
words, <q>If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>But does God work this great work in the soul gradually,
or instantaneously?</q> Perhaps it may be gradually wrought
in some: I mean, in this sense, they do not advert to the particular
moment wherein sin ceases to be. But it is infinitely
desirable, were it the will of God, that it should be done instantaneously;
that the Lord should destroy sin <q>by the
breath of his mouth,</q> in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye. And so he generally does&mdash;a plain fact, of which
there is evidence enough to satisfy any unprejudiced person.
<emph>Thou</emph>, therefore, look for it every moment.</q>&mdash;See

<p>
Oberlin Views Of Sanctification.
</p>

<p>
In the fall of 1836, during an interesting revival of religion
in Oberlin, Ohio, the minds of many became deeply interested
in the inquiry, <q>Can we live holy lives? and, if we can,
how?</q> At first, fears were entertained that some would
run into the errors of the Perfectionists; but, finally, after
much prayer and investigation, they adopted the following
views of sanctification:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That entire obedience to the moral law constitutes
entire sanctification or holiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That all moral agents are able to render this obedience.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. That because all moral agents are able to render
this obedience, they are bound to do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. That sufficient grace for the actual attainment of this
state is abundantly in the gospel, and that nothing prevents
any Christian from making this attainment in this life, but a
neglect to avail himself of the proffered grace of Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. That all are bound to aim at and pray for this attainment
in this life, and that aiming at this state is indispensable
to Christian character.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. That obedience to the moral law, or a state of entire
sanctification, is in such a sense attainable, as to make it an
object of rational pursuit, with the <emph>expectation of attaining it</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>7. That the philosophy of the mind, the commandments
of God, the promises and provisions of the gospel, and the
attainments of Paul and many others, should be presented, to
induce men to aim at a state of entire sanctification, with the
expectation of attaining it.</q>
</p>

</quote>

<p>
Since these views were embraced at Oberlin, they have
been extensively circulated by many books and pamphlets,
and a paper, entitled the <hi rend='italic'>Oberlin Evangelist</hi>. By many
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
Christians and ministers of different denominations these
views have been received; but by others they are opposed.

<head>Waldenses.</head>

<p>
Many authors of note make the antiquity of this denomination
coeval with the apostolic age. The following is an
extract from their confession of faith, which is said to have
been copied out of certain manuscripts, bearing date nearly
four hundred years before the time of Luther:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. That the Scriptures teach that there is one God,
almighty, all-wise, and all-good, who made all things by his
goodness; for he formed Adam in his own image and likeness;
but that, by the envy of the devil, sin entered into the
world; and that we are sinners in and by Adam.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. That Christ was promised to our fathers, who received
the law; that so knowing, by the law, their unrighteousness
and insufficiency, they might desire the coming of Christ, to
satisfy for their sins, and accomplish the law by himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>3. That Christ was born in the time appointed by God
the Father; that is to say, in the time when all iniquity
abounded, that he might show us grace and mercy, as being
faithful; that Christ is our life, truth, peace, and righteousness,
as also our pastor, advocate, and priest, who died for
the salvation of all who believe, and is risen for our justification;
that there is no mediator and advocate with God
the Father, save Jesus Christ; that, after this life, there are
only two places, the one for the saved, and the other for the
damned; that the feasts, the vigils of saints, the water
which they call holy, as also to abstain from flesh on certain
days, and the like, but especially the masses, are the inventions
of men, and ought to be rejected; that the sacraments
are signs of the holy thing, visible forms of the invisible
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>
grace; and that it is good for the faithful to use those signs,
or visible forms, but that they are not essential to salvation;
that there are no other sacraments but baptism and the Lord's
supper; that we ought to honor the secular powers, by subjection,
ready obedience, and paying of tribute.</q>

<p>
The disciples of Henry Allen, of Nova Scotia, who began
to propagate his doctrines in that country about the year
1778, and died in 1783, during which interval he made many
proselytes, and at his death left a considerable party behind
him, though now much declined. He published several
treatises and sermons, in which he declares that the souls of
all the human race are emanations, or rather parts, of the one
great Spirit; that they were all present in Eden, and were
actually in the first transgression. He supposes that our first
parents, in innocency, were pure spirits, and that the material
world was not then made; but that, in consequence of the
fall, that mankind might not sink into utter destruction, this
world was produced, and men clothed with material bodies;
and that all the human race will, in their turn, be invested
with such bodies, and in them enjoy a state of probation for
immortal happiness.

<head>Johnsonians.</head>

<p>
The followers of Mr. John Johnson, many years Baptist
minister at Liverpool, in the last century, of whose followers
there are still several congregations in different parts of
England. He denied that faith was a duty, or even action
of the soul, and defined it <q>an active principle</q> conferred
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>
by grace; and denied also the duty of ministers to exhort the
unconverted, or preach any <emph>moral duties</emph> whatever.
</p>

<p>
Though Mr. Johnson entertained high Supralapsarian notions
on the divine decrees, he admitted the universality of
the death of Christ. On the doctrine of the Trinity, his
followers are said to have embraced the indwelling scheme,
with Calvinistic views of justification and the atonement.

<head>Donatists.</head>

<p>
A denomination which arose in the fourth century.
They derived their name from Donatus, bishop of Numidia.
They maintained that their community was alone to be considered
as the true church, and avoided all communication
with other churches, from an apprehension of contracting
their impurity and corruption. Hence they pronounced the
sacred rites and institutions void of all virtue and efficacy
among those Christians who were not precisely of their sentiments,
and not only rebaptized those who came over to
their party from other churches, but, with respect to those
who had been ordained ministers of the gospel, they either
deprived them of their office, or obliged them to be ordained
the second time.

who maintained that it was lawful for every one to baptize
himself. There is at this day an inconsiderable sect in Russia
who are known by this name, and who perform the rite upon

of the chrism or unction again administered to them. They
are very numerous in Moscow.

<head>Tao-Se, or Taou-Tsze.</head>

<p>
The name of a famous sect among the Chinese, who owe
their rise to <hi rend='italic'>Laou-tsze Lao Kian</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>Laokium</hi>, a philosopher,
who lived, if we may credit his disciples, about five hundred
years before Christ. He professed to restore the religion of
<hi rend='italic'>Tao</hi>, (<hi rend='italic'>Taou</hi>,)
or Reason. Some of his writings are still extant,
and are full of maxims and sentiments of virtue and
morality. Among others, this sentence is often repeated in
them: <q><hi rend='italic'>Tao</hi> hath produced one, one hath produced two,
two have produced three, and three have produced all things.</q>
</p>

<p>
The morality of this philosopher and his disciples is not
unlike that of the Epicureans, consisting in a tranquillity of
mind, free from all vehement desires and passions. But as
this tranquillity would be disturbed by thoughts of death, they
boast of a liquor that has the power of rendering them
immortal. They are addicted to chemistry, alchemy, and
magic, and are persuaded that, by the assistance of demons,
whom they invoke, they can obtain all that they desire. The
hope of avoiding death prevailed upon a great number of
mandarins to study this diabolical art, and certain credulous
and superstitious emperors brought it greatly into vogue.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of this sect, concerning the formation of the
world, according to Dr. Milne, much resembles that of the
Epicureans. If they do not maintain the eternity of matter,
on the other hand, they do not deny it; but, in analogy with
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
the favorite science of alchemy, they represent the first pair
as drawn out of the boiling mouth of an <q>immense crucible,</q>
by a celestial being. The Platonic notion of an
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>anima mundi</foreign>,
or soul of the world, is very common; and hence it is that
the heavens are considered the body of this imaginary being,
the wind its breath, the lights of heaven as proceeding from
its eyes, the watery fluids as its spittle and tears.

to his impulses, by remaining in a state of absolute
rest, or quietude, till we attain the perfection of the unitive
life</q>&mdash;a life of union with, and, as it should seem, of absorption

<p>
The followers of Ludovic Muggleton, a journeyman tailor,
who, with his companion Reeves, set up for great prophets,
in the time of Cromwell. They pretended to absolve or
condemn whom they pleased, and gave out that they were
the two last witnesses spoken of in the Revelation, who
were to appear previous to the final destruction of the world.
They affirmed that there was no devil at all without the body
of man or woman; that the devil is man's spirit of unclean
reason and cursed imagination; that the ministry in this
world, whether prophetical or ministerial, is all a lie, and
abomination to the Lord; with a variety of other vain and
inconsistent tenets.

<head>Yezidees, Or Worshippers Of The Devil.</head>

<p>
From a very interesting work recently published by Asahel
Grant, M. D., a medical missionary to the Nestorians, we
copy the following account:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The passage of the Tigris transferred me from Mesopotamia
into Assyria, and I stood upon the ruins of Nineveh,
<q>that great city,</q> where the prophet Jonah proclaimed the
dread message of Jehovah to so many repenting thousands
whose deep humiliation averted for a time the impending ruin.
But when her proud monarchs had scourged idolatrous Israel
and carried the ten tribes into captivity, and raised their
hands against Judah and the holy city, the inspired strains
of the eloquent Nahum, clothed in terrible sublimity as they
were, met their full accomplishment in the utter desolation
of one of the largest cities on which the sun ever shone.
<q>Nineveh is laid waste! who will bemoan her? She is
empty, and void, and waste; her nobles dwell in the dust;
her people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man
gathereth them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Where her gorgeous palaces once resounded to the strains
of music and the shouts of revelry, a few black tents of the
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
wandering Arab and Tûrkomân are now scattered among
the shapeless mounds of earth and rubbish,&mdash;the ruins of the
city,&mdash;as if in mockery of her departed glory; while their
tenants were engaged in the fitting employment of weaving
<q>sackcloth of hair,</q> as if for the mourning attire of the
world's great emporium, whose <q>merchants</q> were multiplied
above the stars of heaven. The largest mound, from
which very ancient relics and inscriptions are dug, is now
crowned with the Moslem village of Neby Yûnas, or the
prophet Jonah, where his remains are said to be interred,
and over which has been reared, as his mausoleum, a temple
of Islâm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Soon after leaving the ruins of Nineveh, we came in
sight of two villages of the Yezidees, the reputed worshippers
of the devil. Large and luxuriant olive-groves, with their
rich green foliage, and fruit just ripening in the autumnal
sun, imparted such a cheerful aspect to the scene as soon
dispelled whatever of pensive melancholy had gathered around
me, while treading upon the dust of departed greatness.
Several white sepulchres of Yezidee sheiks attracted attention
as I approached the villages. They were in the form
of fluted cones or pyramids, standing upon quadrangular
bases, and rising to the height of some twenty feet or more.
We became the guests of one of the chief Yezidees of Baa-sheka,
whose dwelling, like others in the place, was a rude
stone structure, with a flat terrace roof. Coarse felt carpets
were spread for our seats in the open court, and a formal
welcome was given us; but it was evidently not a very cordial
one. My Turkish cavass understood the reason, and at once
removed it. Our host had mistaken me for a Mahometan
towards whom the Yezidees cherish a settled aversion. As
soon as I was introduced to him as a Christian, and he had
satisfied himself that this was my true character, his whole
deportment was changed. He at once gave me a new and
cordial welcome, and set about supplying our wants with
new alacrity. He seemed to feel that he had exchanged a
Moslem foe for a Christian friend, and I became quite satisfied
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
of the truth of what I had often heard,&mdash;that the Yezidees
are friendly towards the professors of Christianity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>They are said to cherish a high regard for the Christian
religion, of which clearly they have some corrupt remains.
They practise the rite of baptism, make the sign of the
cross, so emblematical of Christianity in the East, put off
their shoes, and kiss the threshold when they enter a Christian
church; and it is said that they often speak of wine as the
blood of Christ, hold the cup with both hands, after the
sacramental manner of the East, when drinking it, and, if a
drop chance to fall on the ground, they gather it up with
religious care.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>They believe in one supreme God, and, in some sense at
least, in Christ as a Savior. They have also a remnant of
Sabianism, or the religion of the ancient fire-worshippers.
They bow in adoration before the rising sun, and kiss his
first rays when they strike on a wall or other object near
them; and they will not blow out a candle with their breath,
or spit in the fire, lest they should defile that sacred element.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Circumcision and the passover, or a sacrificial festival
allied to the passover in time and circumstance, seem also to
identify them with the Jews; and, altogether, they certainly
present a most singular chapter in the history of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>That they are really the worshippers of the devil can
only be true, if at all, in a modified sense, though it is true
that they pay him so much deference as to refuse to speak of
him disrespectfully, (perhaps for fear of his vengeance;) and,
instead of pronouncing his name, they call him the <q>lord of
the evening,</q> or <q>prince of darkness;</q> also, Sheik Maazen,
or Exalted Chief. Some of them say that Satan was a fallen
angel, with whom God was angry; but he will at some future
day be restored to favor, and there is no reason why they
should treat him with disrespect.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Christians of Mesopotamia report that the Yezidees
make votive offerings to the devil, by throwing money and
jewels into a certain deep pit in the mountains of Sinjar,
where a large portion of them reside; and it is said that
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
when that district, which has long been independent, was
subjugated by the Turks, the pacha compelled the Yezidee
priest to disclose the place, and then plundered it of a large
treasure, the offerings of centuries. The Yezidees here call
themselves Daseni, probably from the ancient name of the
district, Dasen, which was a Christian bishopric in early
times. Their chief place of concourse, the religious temple
of the Yezidees, is said to have once been a Christian church
or convent. The late Mr. Rich speaks of the Yezidees as
<q>lively, brave, hospitable, and good-humored,</q> and adds that,
<q>under the British government, much might be made of
them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The precise number of the Yezidees it is difficult to
estimate, so little is known of them; but it is probable that
we must reckon them by tens of thousands, instead of the
larger computations which have been made by some travellers,
who have received their information merely from report.
Still they are sufficiently numerous to form an important
object of attention to the Christian church; and I trust, as
we learn more about them, sympathy, prayer, and effort, will
be enlisted in their behalf. It will be a scene of no ordinary
interest when the voice of prayer and praise to God shall
ascend from hearts now devoted to the service of the prince
of darkness, <q>the worshippers of the devil</q>! May that day
be hastened on!</q>

The following are some of the chief tenets held by the
Greek or Russian church:&mdash;They disown the authority of
the pope, and deny that the church of Rome is the true catholic
church. They do not baptize their children till they are
three, four, five, six, ten, nay, sometimes eighteen years of
age: baptism is performed by trine immersion. They insist
that the sacrament of the Lord's supper ought to be administered
in both kinds, and they give the sacrament to children
immediately after baptism. They grant no indulgences, nor
do they lay any claim to the character of infallibility, like the
church of Rome. They deny that there is any such place as
purgatory; notwithstanding, they pray for the dead, that God
would have mercy on them at the general judgment. They
practise the invocation of saints; though, they say, they do
not invoke them as deities, but as intercessors with God.
They exclude confirmation, extreme unction, and matrimony
out of the seven sacraments. They deny auricular confession
to be a divine precept, and say it is only a positive injunction
of the church. They pay no religious homage to the eucharist.
They administer the communion in both kinds to the
laity, both in sickness and in health, though they have never
applied themselves to their confessors, because they are persuaded
that a lively faith is all which is requisite for the worthy
receiving of the Lord's supper. They maintain that the
Holy Ghost proceeds only from the Father, and not from the
Son. They believe in predestination. They admit of no
images in relief or embossed work, but use paintings and
sculptures in copper or silver. They approve of the marriage
of priests, provided they enter into that state before their admission
into holy orders. They condemn all fourth marriages.
They observe a number of holy days, and keep four
fasts in the year more solemn than the rest, of which the fast
in Lent, before Easter, is the chief. They believe the doctrine
of consubstantiation, or the union of the body of Christ
with the sacramental bread.

The Russians adhere to the doctrine and ceremonies of
the Greek church, though they are now independent of the

patriarch of Constantinople. The church service is contained
in twenty-four volumes, folio, in the Sclavonian language,
which is not well understood by the common people.

<head>Primitive Christians.</head>

<p>
A new sect, professing to be an association of Christians to
promote the revival and spread of primitive Christianity, has
recently sprung up at Bradford, in England. Its originators,
or founders, are a Mr. Barker and a Mr. Trother, who have
recently been expelled from the ministry of the New Connection
of Methodists, by the annual assembly or conference of
the members of that body, for some difference of opinion on
doctrinal points between them and the conference.

<head>Trinitarians.</head>

<p>
By this term we are to understand those who believe that
there are three distinct, persons in the Godhead, the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Father</hi>,
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Son</hi>, and
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Holy Spirit</hi>, the same in substance, equal in power
and dignity, and that these <emph>three</emph> are <emph>one</emph>. Hence it is said they
believe in a <hi rend='italic'>triune</hi> God. (See Deut. 6:4. 2 Kings 19:15.
Ps. 19:1; 83:18; 139:7. Isa. 6:3, 9; 9:6; 11:3; 14:5,
23, 25. Jer. 17:10; 23:6. Ezek. 8:1, 3. Matt. 3:16, 17;
9:6; 18:20; 23:19. Luke 1:76; 24:25. John 1:1;
2:1; 5:19, 23; 10:30; 16:10, 15. Acts 5:4; 28:23,
25. Rom. 1:5; 9:5; 14:12, 19. 1 Cor. 2:10; 8:6.
2 Cor. 13:14. Phil. 2:5, 6, 7, &amp;c.; 3:21. Heb. 1:3, 6,
10, 11, 12; 9:14; 13:8. 1 John 5:7, 20. Rev. 1:4,
5, 6, 8; 3:14; 5:13, &amp;c.) The Unitarians believe that
there is but one person in the Godhead, and that this person
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
is the Father; and they insist that the Trinitarian distinction
of persons is contradictory and absurd.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>unity</emph> of God is a doctrine which both parties consider
the foundation of all true religion.
</p>

<p>
Although the doctrine of the Trinity is ostensibly the main
subject of dispute between Trinitarians and Unitarians, yet
it is in reality respecting the character of Christ. Those
who believe in his proper deity very easily dispose of all the
other difficulties in the Trinitarian system; while anti-Trinitarians
find more fault with this doctrine than any other in
the Trinitarian creed; and the grand obstacle to their reception
of the Trinitarian faith is removed, when they can admit
that Jesus Christ is God, as well as man; so that the burden
of labor, on both sides, is either to prove or disprove the
proper deity of the Son of God.
</p>

<p>
In proof of this doctrine, the Trinitarians urge many declarations
of the Scripture, which, in their opinion, admit of no
consistent explanation upon the Unitarian scheme; they there
find that offices are assigned to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit,
which none but God can perform; particularly the creation
of the world, and the grand decisions of the day of judgment.
As they read the Scriptures, the attributes of <hi rend='italic'>omnipotence</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>omniscience</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>omnipresence</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>unchangeableness</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>eternity</hi>, are
ascribed to Jesus Christ; and they infer that a being to
whom all these perfections are ascribed must be truly God,
coëqual and coëternal with the Father.
</p>

<p>
The Unitarians, on the other hand, contend that some of
these passages are interpolations, and that the others are either
mistranslated or misunderstood. The passage in John, in
particular, respecting the <emph>three</emph> that bear record, &amp;c., has
been set aside by such high authority, that they consider it
unfair to introduce it in the controversy.

The excellent and learned Stillingfleet, in the preface to

both sides yield that the matter they dispute about is above
their reach, the wisest course they can take is, to assert and
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
defend <emph>what is revealed</emph>, and not to be <emph>peremptory</emph> and
quarrelsome about that which is acknowledged to be above our comprehension;

<head>Millenarians.</head>

<p>
The Millenarians are those who believe that Christ will
reign personally on earth for a thousand years; and their
name, taken from the Latin <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mille</foreign>,
a thousand, has a direct
allusion to the duration of the spiritual empire.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of the millennium, or a future paradisaical
state of the earth, it is said, is not of Christian, but of Jewish
origin. The tradition is attributed to Elijah, which fixes the
duration of the world, in its present imperfect condition, to
six thousand years, and announces the approach of a Sabbath
of a thousand years of universal peace and plenty, to be
ushered in by the glorious advent of the Messiah. This idea
may be traced in the Epistle of Barnabas, and in the opinions
of Papias, who knew of no written testimony in its behalf.
It was adopted by the author of the Revelation, by
Justin Martyr, by Irenæus, and by a long succession of the
fathers. As the theory is animating and consolatory, when
it is divested of cabalistic numbers and allegorical decorations,
it will no doubt always retain a number of adherents.
</p>

<p>
However the Millenarians may differ among themselves
respecting the nature of this great event, it is agreed, on all
hands, that such a revolution will be effected in the latter
days, by which vice and its attendant misery shall be banished
from the earth; thus completely forgetting all those dissensions
and animosities by which the religious world hath been
agitated, and terminating the grand drama of Providence with
<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>
universal felicity. We are not unmindful of the prophetic
language of Isaiah, (49:22, 23,) together with a sublime
passage from the book of the Revelation, (11:15,) with
which the canon of Scripture concludes&mdash;<q>Thus saith the
Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles,
and set up my standard to the people. And kings shall be
thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers,
[they shall become good themselves, and be the protectors of
religion and liberty,] and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,
for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. And the
seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven,
saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the
kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign
forever and ever.</q> (See Matt 13:29, 30; 27:32. Luke
17:29, 30. Acts 3:21. Heb. 1:12. Phil. 3:9, 11. 2

<head>Whitefield Calvinistic Methodists.</head>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Tabernacle</hi> or
<hi rend='italic'>Lady Huntingdon Connection</hi>, formed
by Whitefield, is so called from the name given to several
places of worship, in London, Bristol, &amp;c. In some of the
chapels in this Connection, the service of the church of
England is read; in others, the worship is conducted much
in the same way as among the Congregationalists; while, in
all, the system of supply is more or less kept up, consisting in
the employment, for a month or six weeks, of ministers from
different parts of the country, who either take the whole duty,
or assist the resident minister. Some of the congregations
consist of several thousand hearers; and, by the blessing of
God on the rousing and faithful sermons which are usually
delivered to them, very extensive good is effected in the way
of conversion. Most of the ministers now employed as supplies
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
in this Connection are of the Congregational order, to
which, of late years, there appears to be a gradual approximation;
and it is not improbable that ere long both bodies will
coalesce. The number of chapels belonging to this body, at
the present time, is about sixty, in all of which the liturgy
of the church of England is read, and most of her forms
scrupulously kept up. The ministers, who used formerly to
supply at different chapels in the course of the year, are
now become more stationary, and have assumed more of
the pastoral character. They have a respectable college at
Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire.

Those who refused to take the oaths to government, and
who were, in consequence, under certain incapacities, and
liable to certain severe penalties. The members of the
Episcopal church of Scotland have long been denominated
Nonjurors; but perhaps they are now called so improperly,

is more on account of ecclesiastical than political principles.

<head>Nonconformists.</head>

<p>
Those who refuse to join the established church. Nonconformists
in England may be considered of three sorts:&mdash;1.
Such as absent themselves from divine worship in the
established church through total irreligion, and attend the
service of no other persuasion.&mdash;2. Such as absent themselves
on the plea of conscience; as, Presbyterians, Independents,
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
Baptists, &amp;c.&mdash;3. Internal Nonconformists, or
unprincipled clergymen, who applaud and propagate doctrines
quite inconsistent with several of those articles they
promised on oath to defend. The word is generally used in
reference to those ministers who were ejected from their livings
by the Act of Uniformity, in 1662. The number of
these was about two thousand. However some affect to treat
these men with indifference, and suppose that their consciences
were more tender than they need be, it must be
remembered that they were men of as extensive learning,
great abilities, and pious conduct, as ever appeared.

<head>Christian Connection.</head>

<p>
This denomination, among themselves, are generally called
simply <hi rend='italic'>Christians</hi>. This they do merely to denote their
character as the followers of Christ; but, when applied to
them collectively, it necessarily becomes the name of a denomination.
They are sometimes, by their opposers, called
<hi rend='italic'>Christ-ians</hi>; but this pronunciation of the word they universally
reject as very improper.
</p>

<p>
The Christians began to associate and to form a distinct
people about the beginning of the nineteenth century, so that
they may be said to have existed but about forty years.
They seem to have sprung up almost simultaneously in
different and remote parts of the country, without any interchange
of sentiments, concert of action, or even knowledge
of each other's views or movements, till after a public stand
had been taken in several parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
The first branch arose in Virginia and North Carolina,
and consisted of seceders from the Methodists. At first, there
were about one thousand communicants.
</p>

<p>
The northern branch of this denomination sprung up in
New England. It commenced by the formation of several
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
new churches, under the administration of a few ministers
who had separated themselves from the Baptists, who were
soon joined by several other ministers, and nearly whole
churches, from the same denomination.
</p>

<p>
The western branch arose in Kentucky, and was composed
of seceders from the Presbyterians. Some of their ministers
were men of strong and well-cultivated minds, who urged
forward the reform they had undertaken, till they have spread
over most of the Western States.
</p>

<p>
In all these different sections, their leading purpose, at first,
appears to have been, not so much to establish any peculiar or
distinctive doctrine, as to assert for individuals and churches
more liberty and independence in relation to matters of faith
and practice; to shake off the authority of human creeds,
and the shackles of prescribed modes and forms; to make the
Bible their only guide, claiming for every man the right to
judge for himself what is its doctrine, and what are its
requirements; and in practice to follow more strictly the
simplicity of the apostles and primitive Christians.
</p>

<p>
This class of believers recognize no individual as a leader
or founder, and no man claims this high eminence, although
several persons were instrumental in giving rise and progress
to the society. They point all to Christ as the Leader and
Founder, and professedly labor to bring all to the first principles
of original, apostolic Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Seceding, as the first ministers did, from different denominations,
they necessarily brought with them some of the
peculiarities of faith and usage in which they had been
educated. But the two prominent sentiments that led them
out, both kept them together, by rendering them tolerant
toward each other, and gradually brought them to be very
similar both in faith and practice. These two sentiments
were, that the Scriptures <emph>only</emph> should be consulted as a rule
of faith and duty, and that all Christians should enjoy universal
toleration. Hence scarcely any churches have written
creeds, although nearly all record their principles of action.
Very few are Trinitarians, though nearly all believe in the
<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>
preëxistence and proper Sonship of Christ. Perhaps not
any believe in or practise sprinkling, but almost all practise
immersion; from which circumstance many, though very
improperly, call them Christian Baptists.
</p>

<p>
Perfect uniformity does not exist among all the members
of this community, although the approximation to it is far
greater than many have supposed it ever could be without a
written creed. But there are several important points in
which they generally agree fully; and these are regarded as
sufficient to secure Christian character, Christian fellowship,
and concert of action. Some of these points are the following:&mdash;That
the Scriptures, including the Old and New
Testament, were given by inspiration of God, and are sufficient
to teach what men should believe, and what they
should practise. That every man has a right to study the
Scriptures, and to exercise his own judgment with regard to
their true import and meaning. That there is one God,
perfect and infinite. That Jesus Christ is the Son of God
in the highest possible sense, and that salvation is found in
him alone. That all men have sinned and come short of the
glory of God, therefore are polluted and guilty. That no
transgressor can find pardon but by repentance and faith in
Jesus Christ. That the Holy Spirit reproves all sinners, and
comforts all Christians. That whoever has sinned has also
a way of salvation set before him. That pardon and eternal
salvation are found alone through regeneration. That none
are proper subjects of church membership, or the ordinances
except the regenerated. That God calls men to the ministry,
and no others are his true ministers. That perseverance to
the end is the only condition on our part that can secure our
eternal happiness. That revivals of religion are of the first
importance, and should be labored for continually. That
every believer should be immersed, and become a public
member of some visible church. That every church should
continue to observe the Lord's supper. That there will be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust;
and that, at the day of judgment, the righteous and the wicked
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
will be separated, and pass, the righteous into everlasting
life, and the wicked into eternal damnation.
</p>

<p>
On all the above points, there is but very little difference
of opinion or practice throughout the whole body.
</p>

<p>
Candidates for baptism and church membership are required
to give the reason of their hope, by a relation of
their Christian experience; and persons coming from other
churches are expected to furnish satisfactory testimonials of
their Christian character.
</p>

<p>
Their communions are always open and free for all Christians
of every denomination; but no unconverted or immoral
person is invited to the Lord's table.
</p>

<p>
Each church is so far independent as to have a right to
transact all its internal affairs without foreign interference.
Every church makes choice of its own minister, agrees on
its own principles of action, and administers its own discipline,
as they understand the New Testament; but the
imposition of hands is invariably administered by ordained
ministers.
</p>

<p>
The connection between the several churches, and between
the ministers, is kept up by means of associations
called <hi rend='italic'>conferences</hi>,
each of which is generally composed of the ministers
and churches within a certain district. These hold annual
sessions, at which the ministers meet in person, and the
churches by delegates. The churches and ministers are
generally thus associated; but, if any choose not to do so,
the fraternal bonds are not thereby impaired.
</p>

<p>
Very few of their ministers are thoroughly educated men;
but they are generally well acquainted with the Bible, and many
of them good sermonizers and powerful preachers. All the
important means by which pure Christianity may be advanced
are fast gaining favor both in the ministry and the churches.
</p>

<p>
Within the last few years, there has been a very rapid
spread, and great increase; while all has been settling upon
a firm and consistent basis. While many are engaged calling
sinners to repentance, the churches are set in order, and thus
mightily the word of God grows and prevails.

<head>Puseyites.</head>

<p>
This school of theology, which has become famous both
in England and abroad, had its origin at Oxford, about
A. D. 1838. Some distinguished members of the university
thought that the church of England was in an alarming
position, and that irreligious principles and false doctrines
had been admitted into the measures of the government of
the country on a large scale. To check the progress of
these supposed errors and mischievous practices, they published
a series of <q>Tracts for the Times,</q> on such subjects
as the <hi rend='italic'>constitution of the church; the authority of its ministers;
refutations of the errors of Romanism, and how to
oppose it</hi>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
The Puseyites strenuously assert the <emph>apostolical succession</emph>;
in other words, that the clergy derive their power from
the apostles, through <emph>episcopal</emph> ordination.
</p>

<p>
In regard to <emph>church polity</emph>, they maintain that the church
is an empire and government of its own,&mdash;a government
appointed by God,&mdash;and that its laws, as they are to be
found in the Book of Common Prayer, ought to be implicitly
obeyed. They deprecate the neglect of the <emph>daily service</emph>,
the desecration of festivals, and the scanty administration
of the eucharist.
</p>

<p>
With respect to <emph>sacraments</emph>, the Puseyites hold that they
are not subjects of discussion, or for speculation; but <q>high,
mysterious, awful Christian privileges&mdash;to be <emph>felt</emph>, reverenced,
embraced, realized, acted.</q>
</p>

<p>
With respect to <emph>church authority</emph>, they hold that human
tradition has no place in revelation; that no individuals,
since the apostles, can be regarded as expositors of the
will of Christ; that the <emph>unanimous witness</emph> of Christendom,
as to the teaching of the apostles, is the only and the fully-sufficient
guaranty of the whole revealed faith, and that we
do possess historically such a guaranty in the remains of the
primitive church.
</p>

<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>

<p>
The Puseyites inculcate the necessity of dispensing religious
truth with caution and reverence, not throwing it promiscuously
before minds ill suited to receive it.
</p>

<p>
A characteristic feature of the Oxford school of theology,
is its opposition to what is called the <q>popular religionism
of the day.</q> The masters of the school grieve that men are
sent from the seat of their education with the belief that they
are to <emph>think</emph>, not <emph>read</emph>;
<emph>judge</emph>, rather than <emph>learn</emph>; and look to
their own minds for truth, rather than to some permanent
external standard.
</p>

<p>
At the head of this school are Dr. Pusey, Regius professor
of Hebrew, and canon of Christ Church, Rev. J. Keble,
professor of poetry, Rev. J. H. Newman, Rev. J. Williams,
and Rev. W. Sewall, professor of moral philosophy.

<head>Free Communion Baptists.</head>

<p>
This denomination of Christians dissent from the regular
Baptists on the point that immersion is a prerequisite to the
privileges of a church relation, and permit Christians of all
denominations, in regular church standing, to partake with
them at the Lord's table.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Robert Hall, of England, one of the most
learned and eloquent Baptist ministers of the age, was an unflinching
opposer of the practice of <q>close communion,</q>
which he denounced as <q>unchristian and unnatural.</q> In a
tract written in defence of his views on this subject, he remarks,
<q>It is too much to expect an enlightened public will
be eager to enroll themselves among the members of a sect
which displays much of the intolerance of Popery, without
any portion of its splendor, and prescribes, as the pledge of
conversion, the renunciation of the whole Christian world.</q>
</p>

<p>
In reference to the mode of baptism, Mr. Hall says, <q>I
would not myself baptize in any other way than by immersion,
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
because I look upon immersion as the ancient mode;
that it best represents the meaning of the original term
employed, and the substantial import of this institution; and
because I should think it right to guard against the spirit
of innovation, which, in positive rites, is always dangerous
and progressive; <emph>but I should not think myself authorized
to rebaptize any one who has been sprinkled in adult age</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
This class of Baptists are found chiefly in the western and
northern parts of the state of New York. They number
between forty and fifty churches and ministers.

<head>Transcendentalists.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Transcendent</hi> and
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Transcendental</hi> are technical terms
in philosophy. According to their etymology,
(from <foreign rend='italic'>transcendere</foreign>,)
they signify that which goes beyond a certain
limit; in philosophy, that which goes beyond, or transcends,
the circle of experience, or of what is perceptible by the
senses. Properly speaking, all philosophy is in this sense
transcendental, because all philosophical investigations rise
above the sensual, even if they start from that which is perceptible
by the senses. But philosophical inquiries are to be
distinguished according as they proceed from experience, or
from principles and ideas not derived from that source. The
latter sort are called, in a narrower sense, <emph>pure</emph>,
or <emph>transcendental</emph>.
The school of Kant makes a still further distinction:
it gives the name of <emph>transcendental</emph> to that which does not,
indeed, originate from experience, but yet is connected with
it, because it contains the grounds of the possibility of experience;
but the term <emph>transcendent</emph> it applies to that which
cannot be connected with experience, but transcends the
limit of possible experience and of philosophizing.
</p>

<p>
As applied in this country, especially when used as a term
of reproach, Transcendentalism would designate a system
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>
which builds on feeling, rather than on reason, and relies
more on the imagination than on the judgment. In the main,
however, the Transcendentalists are persons who hold that
man has the power to perceive intuitively truths which transcend
the reach of the senses; but they divide, some taking
the unction of Sentimentalism, and others of Mysticism.

The first Protestant Confession was that presented, in 1530,
to the diet of Augsburg, by the suggestion and under the
direction of John, elector of Saxony. This wise and prudent
prince, with the view of having the principal grounds on
which the Protestants had separated from the Romish communion
distinctly submitted to that assembly, intrusted the
duty of preparing a summary of them to the divines of Wittemberg.
Nor was that task a difficult one; for the Reformed
doctrines had already been digested into seventeen articles,
which had been proposed at the conferences both at Sultzbach
and Smalcald, as the confession of faith to be adopted by the
Protestant confederates. These, accordingly, were delivered
to the elector by Luther, and served as the basis of the celebrated
Augsburg Confession, written <q>by the elegant and
accurate pen of Melancthon</q>&mdash;a work which has been admired
by many even of its enemies, for its perspicuity, piety,
and erudition. It contains twenty-eight chapters, the leading
topics of which are, the true and essential divinity of Christ;
his substitution and vicarious sacrifice; original sin; human
inability; the necessity, freedom, and efficacy of divine grace;
consubstantiation; and particularly justification by faith, to
establish the truth and importance of which was one of its
chief objects. The last seven articles condemn and confute
the Popish tenets of communion in one kind, clerical celibacy,
private masses, auricular confession, legendary traditions,
<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>
monastic vows, and the exorbitant power of the church.
This Confession is silent on the doctrine of predestination.
This is the universal standard of orthodox doctrine among
those who profess to be Lutherans, in which no authoritative
alteration has ever been made.

<head>Armenians.</head>

<p>
The chief point of separation between the Armenians on
the one side, and the Greeks and the Papists on the other,
is, that, while the latter believe in two natures and one person
of Christ, the former believe that the humanity and divinity
of Christ were so united as to form but <emph>one nature</emph>; and
hence they are called <hi rend='italic'>Monophysites</hi>,
signifying <emph>single nature</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Another point on which they are charged with heresy by
the Papists is, that they adhere to the notion that the Spirit
proceeds from the Father only; and in this the Greeks join
them, though the Papists say that he proceeds from the Father
and the Son. In other respects, the Greeks and Armenians
have very nearly the same religious opinions, though
they differ somewhat in their forms and modes of worship.
For instance, the Greeks make the sign of the cross with
three fingers, in token of their belief in the doctrine of the
Trinity, while the Armenians use two fingers, and the Jacobites,
one.
</p>

<p>
The Armenians hold to seven sacraments, like the Latins
although baptism, confirmation, and extreme unction, are all
performed at the same time; and the forms of prayer for
confirmation and extreme unction are perfectly intermingled,
which leads one to suppose that, in fact, the latter sacrament
does not exist among them, except in name, and that this
they have borrowed from the Papists.
</p>

<p>
Infants are baptized both by triple immersion and pouring
water three times upon the head; the former being done,
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
as their books assert, in reference to Christ's having been
three days in the grave, and probably suggested by the
phrase <hi rend='italic'>buried with him in baptism</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The latter ceremony they derive from the tradition that,
when Christ was baptized, he stood in the midst of Jordan,
and John poured water from his hand three times upon his
head. In all their pictures of this scene, such is the representation
of the mode of our Savior's baptism. Converted
Jews, or Mahometans, though adults, are baptized in the
same manner.
</p>

<p>
The Armenians acknowledge sprinkling as a lawful mode
of baptism; for they receive from other churches those that
have merely been sprinkled, without rebaptizing them.
</p>

<p>
They believe firmly in transubstantiation, and worship the
consecrated elements as God.
</p>

<p>
Unleavened bread is used in the sacrament, and the broken
pieces of bread are dipped in undiluted wine, and thus
given to the people.
</p>

<p>
The latter, however, do not handle it, but receive it into
their mouths from the hands of the priest. They suppose it
has in itself a sanctifying and saving power. The Greeks, in
this sacrament, use leavened bread, and wine mixed with water.
</p>

<p>
The Armenians discard the Popish doctrine of purgatory
but yet, most inconsistently, they pray for the dead.
</p>

<p>
They hold to confession of sins to the priests, who impose
penances and grant absolution, though without money, and
they give no indulgences.
</p>

<p>
They pray through the mediation of the virgin Mary, and
other saints. The belief that Mary was always a virgin, is a
point of very high importance with them; and they consider
the thought of her having given birth to children after the
birth of Christ, as in the highest degree derogatory to her
character, and impious.
</p>

<p>
They regard baptism and regeneration as the same thing
and have no conception of any spiritual change; and they
know little of any other terms of salvation than penance, the
Lord's supper, fasting, and good works in general.
</p>

<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>

<p>
The Armenians are strictly Trinitarians in their views,
holding firmly to the supreme divinity of Christ, and the
doctrine of atonement for sin; though their views on the
latter subject, as well as in regard to faith and repentance,
are somewhat obscure. They say that Christ died to atone
for original sin, and that actual sin is to be washed away by
penances,&mdash;which, in their view, is repentance. Penances
are prescribed by the priests, and sometimes consist in an
offering of money to the church, a pilgrimage, or more commonly
in repeating certain prayers, or reading the whole
book of Psalms a specified number of times. Faith in Christ
seems to mean but little more than believing in the mystery
of transubstantiation.&mdash;See

<head>Novatians.</head>

<p>
An heretical sect in the early church, which derives its
name from Novatian, an heresiarch of the third century, who
was ordained a priest of the church of Rome, and afterwards
got himself clandestinely consecrated bishop of Rome,
by three weak men, upon whom he had imposed, and one of
whom afterwards did penance for his concern in the business.
He was never acknowledged bishop of Rome, but
was condemned and excommunicated. He still, however
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>
taught his doctrine, and became the head of the party that
bore his name. He denied, in opposition to the opinion of
the church, that those who had been guilty of idolatry could
be again received by the church.

<head>Nestorians.</head>

<p>
The branch of the Christian church known by this name
is so called from Nestorius, a patriarch of Constantinople,
who was born in Germanica, a city of Syria, in the latter
part of the fourth century. He was educated and baptized
at Antioch, and, soon after his baptism, withdrew to a monastery
in the vicinity of that city. His great reputation for
eloquence, and the regularity of his life, induced the emperor
Theodosius to select him for the see of Constantinople; and
he was consecrated bishop of that church A. D. 429. He
became a violent persecutor of heretics; but, because he favored
the doctrine of his friend Anastasius, that <q>the virgin
Mary cannot with propriety be called the mother of God,</q>
he was anathematized by Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, who,
in his turn, was anathematized by Nestorius. In the council
of Ephesus, A. D. 431, (the third General Council of the
church,) at which Cyril presided, and at which Nestorius
was not present, he was judged and condemned without being
heard, and deprived of his see. He then retired to his monastery,
in Antioch, and was afterwards banished to Petra, in
Arabia, and thence to Oasis, in Egypt, where he died, about
A. D. 435 or 439.
</p>

<p>
The decision of the council of Ephesus caused many difficulties
in the church; and the friends of Nestorius carried
his doctrines through all the Oriental provinces, and established
numerous congregations, professing an invincible
opposition to the decrees of the Ephesian council. Nestorianism
spread rapidly over the East, and was embraced by a
<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>
large number of the oriental bishops. Barsumas, bishop of
Nisibis, labored with great zeal and activity to procure for
the Nestorians a solid and permanent footing in Persia; and
his success was so remarkable that his fame extended throughout
the East. He established a school at Nisibis, which
became very famous, and from which issued those Nestorian
doctors who, in that and the following centuries, spread
abroad their tenets through Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India,
Tartary, and China.
</p>

<p>
The Nestorian church is Episcopal in its government,
like all the other Oriental churches. Its doctrines, also, are,
in general, the same with those of those churches, and they
receive and repeat, in their public worship, the Nicene
creed. Their <emph>distinguishing</emph> doctrines appear to be, their
believing that Mary was not the mother of Jesus Christ, <emph>as
God</emph>, but only <emph>as man</emph>, and that there are, consequently, <emph>two
persons</emph>, as well as <emph>two natures</emph>, in the Son of God. This
notion was looked upon in the earlier ages of the church
as a most momentous error; but it has in later times been
considered more as an error of words than of doctrine; and
that the error of Nestorius was in the words he employed
to express his meaning, rather than in the doctrine itself.
While the Nestorians believe that Christ had <emph>two natures</emph>
and <emph>two persons</emph>, they say <q>that these natures and persons are
so closely and intimately united that they have but one <emph>aspect</emph>.</q>
<q>Now, the word <foreign rend='italic'>barsopa</foreign>, by which they express this
<emph>aspect</emph>, is precisely of the same signification with the Greek
word προσωπον, which signifies <emph>a person</emph>; and hence it is
evident that they attached to the word <emph>aspect</emph> the same idea
that we attach to the word <emph>person</emph>, and that they understood,
by the word <emph>person</emph>, precisely what we understand by the
term <emph>nature</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Nestorians, of all the Christian churches of the East,
have been the most careful and successful in avoiding a multitude
of superstitious opinions and practices, which have infected
the Romish and many Eastern churches.
</p>

<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>

<p>
Our readers are referred to an interesting volume recently
published by Asahel Grant, M. D., in which is contained
strong evidence that the Nestorians and the <q>Lost Tribes</q>
are one people.

A term first given to the Nonjurors, who refused to acknowledge
William III. as their lawful king, and who had
very proud notions of church power; but it is now commonly
used in a more extensive signification, and is applied to all
those who, though far from being Nonjurors, yet form high
conceptions of the authority and jurisdiction of the church.

The First Covenant, Or Confession Of Faith, Of The
First Church In Salem.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We covenant with our Lord, and one with another, and
we do bind ourselves, in the presence of God, to walk together
in all his ways, according as he is pleased to reveal
himself unto us in his blessed word of truth; and do explicitly,
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
in the name and fear of God, profess and protest to
walk as followeth, through the power and grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ:&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We avouch the Lord to be our God, and ourselves to be
his people, in the truth and simplicity of our spirits.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We give ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
word of his grace, for the teaching, ruling, and sanctifying
of us in matters of worship and conversation, resolving to
cleave unto him alone for life and glory, and to reject all
contrary ways, canons, and constitutions of men, in his
worship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We promise to walk with our brethren, with all watchfulness
and tenderness, avoiding jealousies and suspicions,
backbitings, censurings, provokings, secret risings of spirit
against them; but, in all offences, to follow the rule of our
Lord Jesus, and to bear and forbear, give and forgive, as he
hath taught us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In public or private, we will willingly do nothing to the
offence of the church, but will be willing to take advice for
ourselves and ours, as occasion shall be presented.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We will not, in the congregation, be forward, either to
show our own gifts and parts in speaking or scrupling, or
there discover the weakness or failings of our brethren; but
attend an orderly call thereunto, knowing how much the
Lord may be dishonored, and his gospel, and the profession
of it, slighted by our distempers and weaknesses in public.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We bind ourselves to study the advancement of the gospel
in all truth and peace, both in regard to those that are
within or without; no way slighting our sister churches, but
using their counsel, as need shall be; not laying a stumbling-block
before any, no, not the Indians, whose good we desire
to promote; and so to converse, as we may avoid the very
appearance of evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We do hereby promise to carry ourselves in all lawful
obedience to those that are over us, in church or commonwealth,
knowing how well pleasing it will be to the Lord,
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>
that they should have encouragement in their places, by our
not grieving their spirits through our irregularities.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We resolve to approve ourselves to the Lord in our particular
callings, shunning idleness, as the bane of any state;
nor will we deal hardly or oppressingly with any, wherein we
are the Lord's stewards.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Promising, also, unto our best ability, to teach our
children and servants the knowledge of God, and of his will,
that they may serve him also; and all this, not by any
strength of our own, but by the Lord Christ, whose blood
we desire may sprinkle this our covenant, made in his
name</q>

<q>The above is a covenant,</q> says a learned divine, <q>to
which all good Christians, of every denomination, to the end

and containing sentiments which are felt to be eloquent by
every amiable and pious heart,&mdash;and should form the bond
to unite the whole church on earth, as they will unite the

<head>Christian Connection.</head>

<p>
This denomination of Christians are found in almost every state in
the Union, and in Canada. In 1841, there were in America forty-one
conferences, five hundred and ninety-one churches, five hundred and
ninety-three ordained preachers, one hundred and eighty-nine unordained
preachers, and about thirty thousand church members.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Publications.</hi>&mdash;This connection has three religious
periodicals, viz. The <hi rend='italic'>Christian Palladium</hi>, Union Mills, N. Y.;
<hi rend='italic'>Christian Journal</hi>, Exeter,
N. H.; and the <hi rend='italic'>Christian Messenger</hi>, Jacksonville, Illinois.

<head>Calvinistic Congregationalists.</head>

<p>
So late as the year 1700, eighty years after the landing of the Pilgrims,
there were, in all the New England States then settled, but
one Episcopal church, no Methodist church, and, with the exception
of Rhode Island, not more than half a dozen Baptist churches. At
that time, however, there were one hundred and twenty Congregational
churches, composed of emigrants from Europe and their descendants,
and thirty others composed of converted Indians. The great mass of
the descendants of the early settlers of New England are Congregationalists,
maintaining, substantially, the same views of church order
and religious faith which their venerated ancestry sacrificed home,
and country, and life, to maintain and perpetuate.
</p>

<p>
The present number of Congregational churches in New England
is about fifteen hundred; and in the Middle and Western States there
are about fourteen hundred and fifty; although the mode of church
government adopted by some of them is, in some degree, modified by
the <q>Plan of Union</q> with Presbyterians. These churches contain,
as nearly as can be ascertained, about one hundred and ninety-four
thousand communicants.
</p>

<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>

<p>
Recently, symptoms of dissatisfaction with the <q>Plan of Union</q>
have extensively developed themselves, particularly in New York,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa; and the probability
now is, that a pure Congregational mode of church government will
soon be generally adopted by the descendants of New-England Congregationalists,
who are scattered over the great West.
</p>

<p>
These Congregational churches are more particularly denominated
<hi rend='italic'>Orthodox</hi> than any other churches in the United States, and adhere
to the doctrines of Calvin or Hopkins.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Publications.</hi>&mdash;The Orthodox Congregationalists publish a
great number of periodicals, the principal of which are the <hi rend='italic'>Boston
Recorder</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>New England Puritan</hi>, Boston, Mass.; the
<hi rend='italic'>Christian Mirror</hi>, Portland, Me.; the
<hi rend='italic'>Congregational Journal</hi>, Concord, N. H.; the
<hi rend='italic'>Vermont Chronicle</hi>, Windsor, Vt.; the
<hi rend='italic'>Congregational Observer</hi>, Hartford,
Ct.; and several in the Western States, which are sustained partly by
Congregationalists and partly by Presbyterians.

<head>Disciples Of Christ.</head>

<p>
The largest number of this denomination is found in the region of
country around where its doctrines were first propagated. There are,
however, societies of this class of Christians in other parts of the country,
some adopting, and others rejecting, its views on baptism. The
total number in the United States is about one hundred and fifty
thousand.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Publications.</hi> The Disciples of Christ publish a periodical, the
<hi rend='italic'>Millennial Harbinger</hi>, at Bethany,
Va., (edited by <hi rend='smallcaps'>Campbell</hi>, the founder
of the sect,) and another, the <hi rend='italic'>Evangelist</hi>, at Carthage, Ohio.

We have already given, in the historical account of the Episcopal
Church, in this Country, a few brief notices of its condition; and we
now present the following additional statistics.
</p>

<p>
List Of Bishops.
</p>

<p>
It being the essential principle of Episcopacy, that legitimate church
authority is not originated by voluntary associations of men, but is of
Divine origin, derived from Christ, and transmitted through an unbroken
succession of Bishops, who trace their appointment to Him,
we here give a list of the names of persons who constitute such
succession.

<head>Friends.</head>

<p>
The Friends are found in most of the states in the Union, and some
in the British Provinces. They are most numerous in Pennsylvania,
a state first settled by them, under their worthy head and father, in
this country, <hi rend='smallcaps'>William Penn</hi>, in 1682.
</p>

<p>
In England and Ireland, they number about fifty thousand; and in
America, about two hundred thousand, and are divided into four hundred
and fifty congregations. About half are Orthodox, and the other
half Hicksites, or followers of <hi rend='smallcaps'>Elias Hicks</hi>,
who died at Jericho, N. Y.
in 1830, aged 76.

<head>Jews.</head>

<p>
The number of Jews in the United States is estimated at about four
thousand. They have synagogues in Newport, R. I., the cities of New
York, Philadelphia, Charleston, S. C., and in other parts of the country.
Their mode of worship is exceedingly interesting. With regard to the
number of this people in the world, Blackwood's Magazine says:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>The statistics of the Jewish population are among the most singular
circumstances of this most singular of all people. Under all their
calamities and dispersions, they seem to have remained at nearly the
same amount as in the days of David and Solomon&mdash;never much more
in prosperity, never much less after ages of suffering. Nothing like
this has occurred in the history of any other race; Europe in general
having doubled its population within the last hundred years, and England
nearly tripled hers within the last half century; the proportion of
America being still more rapid, and the world crowding in a constantly-increasing
ratio. Yet the Jews seem to stand still in this vast and
general movement. The population of Judea, in its most palmy days,
probably did not exceed, if it reached, four millions. The numbers
who entered Palestine from the wilderness, were evidently not much
more than three; and their census, according to the German statists,
who are generally considered to be exact, is now nearly the same as
that of the people under Moses&mdash;about three millions.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the above, Judge Noah, of New York, a learned Jew, remarks:&mdash;
</p>

<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>

<p>
<q>We apprehend there is some error in the above statistics, and that
the number of Jews throughout the world may be estimated at nearer
six millions than three. There are more than a million in Poland and
Russia; in all Asia, there are full two millions; half a million in Austria;
in the Barbary States and Africa, a million; in all Europe, two
millions and a half. We do not think, during the most splendid periods
of Jewish history, that they ever exceeded four millions; but then their
colonies and countries held tributary in Europe and Asia, amounted to
many millions more. For example, at one period all Spain paid tribute
to King Solomon; and all Spain and Portugal, at this day, are descendants
of the Jews and Moors; and there are many thousands of Jews,
in both those countries, now adhering in secret to the ancient faith of
their fathers, while outwardly professing the Catholic religion. All the
familiar Spanish and Portuguese names&mdash;Lopez, Mendez, Carvalho,
Fonseca, Rodrigues, Peirara, Azavedo, Montefiores, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;are of
Jewish origin. Their numbers, therefore, will never be accurately
known until the restoration, when thousands who, from convenience
and pride, and some from apprehension, conceal their religion, will be
most eager to avow it when their nation takes rank among the governments
of the earth.</q>

<head>Lutherans.</head>

<p>
The government of the Lutherans is somewhat singular. Where it is
established by law, the supreme head of the state is also supreme head
of the church. They have bishops, but no diocesan episcopacy, except
in Denmark and Sweden. These are called <hi rend='italic'>superintendents</hi> in Germany,
and <hi rend='italic'>presidents</hi> in the United
States. There is but <hi rend='italic'>one</hi> archbishop,
and he is the primate of Sweden.
</p>

<p>
They have in the United States about one thousand churches, four
hundred ministers, seventy thousand communing members, and about
one hundred and forty thousand which do not commune.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Education</hi>, &amp;c.&mdash;They
have a college, located at Gettysburg, Pa.,
and several academies in different parts of the
country; also four theological
seminaries, located at Gettysburg, Pa.; Columbus, Ohio; Lexington,
S. C.; Hartwich, N. Y., a fifth is contemplated in Indiana.
Their different education societies support about eighty beneficiaries,

The Lutherans are one of the most numerous sects of Christians in
the world. The whole number in Europe is estimated at twenty-seven
millions, embracing seventeen reigning sovereigns. This estimate, of

<p>
This class of Christians have twenty-one annual conferences in as
many states; nearly four hundred travelling, and a large number of
unstationed ministers. They have a general conference, which meets
once in four years, consisting of two delegates from every thousand
communicants, one a minister, the other a layman: this is their legislative
body. The number of communicants is about sixty-five thousand.

<head>Presbyterians.</head>

<p>
The Protestant faith was introduced into Scotland about 1527; and
about 1592 Andrew Melville effected the introduction of the Presbyterian
form of church polity. This form, through much persecution,
and even bloodshed, has been maintained ever since. Its creed is
Calvinistic. This church has nearly a thousand ministers, and about
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>
one million five hundred thousand church members. It is the established
religion of Scotland, sustained by law. There are also several
bodies of dissenting Presbyterians in Scotland.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
Presbyterianism was first introduced into England by those Christians
who returned from Frankfort, after the death of Queen Mary.
For a time, it flourished, but at length lapsed into Socinianism. There
are, however, a few churches in England still pure, which are in fellowship
with the Scotch Presbyterians.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
This denomination began its organized existence in America about
the year 1700, and is the offspring of the church of Scotland. Its first
ministers were Rev. Francis McKemie, and the Rev. John Hampton,
who labored in Virginia.
</p>

<p>
The first church of this order was organized in Philadelphia, 1703,
the first presbytery, 1704, and the first synod in 1716. Since that
time, they have steadily increased, and their number in 1840 was
ninety-six presbyteries, twelve hundred and thirty-two ministers,
eighteen hundred and twenty-three churches, and one hundred and
fifty-two thousand four hundred and fifty-one communicants.
</p>

<p>
The Presbyterians are found chiefly in the Middle, Western, and
Southern States. The number of people attached to this form of church
government in the United States, is supposed to exceed two millions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Education.</hi>&mdash;Within the bounds of the church there are
thirteen theological seminaries, three of which are under the care of the General
Assembly. They have a board of education, which has about four
hundred young men in training for the ministry.
</p>

<p>
The Calvinistic publications announce their sentiments.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
In 1837, a division arose in the Presbyterian church, into Old and
New Schools, in consequence of variant views of doctrine and discipline.
The friends of the New School were exscinded, or cut off, from
the old church, but still claim to be the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
church. Unfortunately, the difficulty is not settled; we cannot,
therefore, give the strength of the parties.

<head>Other Presbyterian Communities.</head>

<p>
The Associate Presbyterians have about one hundred ministers, one
hundred and ninety congregations, and twenty thousand communicants.
They are principally found south and west of the Hudson
River.
</p>

<p>
The Reformed Presbyterians, or Covenanters, are located principally
in Ohio. They have about thirty ministers, fifty congregations, and
four thousand communicants.
</p>

<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>

The Associate Reformed have about one hundred and twenty-five

<head>Reformed Dutch Church.</head>

<p>
This church comprises one general synod, and two particular
synods; one at New York, and another at Albany. The two synods
comprise eighteen classes, about two hundred ministers, two hundred
churches, twenty-seven thousand communicants, and a population of
about one hundred and thirty thousand. This denomination of Christians
is found almost entirely in the first settlements in the states of
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

principles of this church.

<head>Roman Catholics.</head>

<p>
This denomination is spread over every section of the United States
and the British Provinces. They form, it is stated, more than three
fourths of the population of the Canadas. They are also found in large
numbers in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. In
this Union, they are most numerous in the Middle States; but in consequence
of the great influx of this people into North America, and
their frequent change of location, it is utterly impossible to state their
numbers, in each state, with any degree of accuracy. Their number
in the United States is variously stated from five hundred thousand to
one million five hundred thousand. Their number, probably, is not
less than eight hundred thousand, nor more than one million two
hundred thousand. The population of Canada, in 1840, was at least
one million.

The first Roman Catholics that came to this country were from
England, under Lord Baltimore, a Catholic nobleman, in 1634. They
settled the state of Maryland; and, much to their honor, while some
of the Protestant provinces were persecuting all those who differed
from them on religious subjects, the Catholic Marylanders protected
all sects that were moral and civil in their deportment.

At the time of the reformation, 1517, papal power, or the power of
the pope of Rome, had acquired so great a spiritual dominion over the
minds and consciences of men, that all Europe submitted to it with
implicit obedience. At the present day, the Roman Catholic religion
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>

is stated to exceed eighty millions. It is the established religion of

<p>
The title of <hi rend='italic'>pope</hi>
was originally given to all bishops. It was first
adopted by Hygenus, A. D. 138; and Pope Boniface III. procured
Phocas, emperor of the East, to confine it to the prelates of Rome, 606.
By the connivance of Phocas, also, the pope's supremacy over the
Christian church was established. The custom of kissing the pope's
toe was introduced in 708. The first sovereign act of the popes of
Rome was by Adrian I., who caused money to be coined with his name,
780. Servius II. was the first pope who changed his name, on his
election, in 844. The first pope who kept an army was Leo IX., 1054.
Gregory VII. obliged Henry IV., emperor of Germany, to stand three
days, in the depth of winter, barefooted, at his castle gate, to implore
his pardon 1077. The pope's authority was firmly fixed in England
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
1079. Appeals from English tribunals to the pope were introduced
1154. Henry II. of England held the stirrup for Pope Alexander III.
to mount his horse, 1161, and also for Becket, 1170. <q>When Louis,
king of France, and Henry II. of England, met Pope Alexander III.
at the castle of Torci, on the Loire, they both dismounted to receive
him, and, holding each of them one of the reins of his bridle, walked
on foot by his side, and conducted him in that submissive manner into
the castle.</q> Pope Adrian IV. was the only Englishman that ever obtained
the tiara. His arrogance was such, that he obliged Frederick I.
to prostrate himself before him, kiss his foot, hold his stirrup, and lead
the white palfrey on which he rode. Celestine III. kicked the emperor
Henry VI.'s crown off his head while kneeling, to show his prerogative
of making and unmaking kings, 1191. The pope collected
the tenths of the whole kingdom of England, 1226. Appeals to Rome
from England were abolished 1533. The words <q>Lord Pope</q> were
struck out of all English books 1541. The papal authority declined
about 1600. Kissing the pope's toe, and other ceremonies, were abolished
by Clement XIV., 1773. The pope became destitute of all
political influence in Europe, 1787. Pius VI. was burnt in effigy at
Paris, 1791. He made submission to the French republic, 1796, was
expelled from Rome, and deposed, February 22, 1798, and died at
Valence, August 19, 1799. Pius VII. was elected in exile, March 13,
1800; he crowned Napoleon, December 2, 1804; was dethroned May
13, 1809; remained a prisoner at Fontainebleau till Napoleon's overthrow;
and was restored May 24, 1814.

Believers in the doctrines of Swedenborg are found in all the states
in the Union. In Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio, are eight ordaining
ministers, ten priests and teaching ministers, fifteen licentiates,
and between thirty and forty societies. There are between two and
three hundred towns or places in the United States where the doctrines
of the New Jerusalem church are received by some portion of the people.
</p>

<p>
The number of Swedenborgians in the United States is about five

<p>
Of this denomination, there are about three hundred churches and
congregations in the United States, and near that number of ministers.
In the city of Boston it is one of the most numerous and influential
classes of Christians, having eighteen societies, most of which are large
and flourishing. In the Middle, Southern, and Western States their
congregations are fewer, but gradually multiplying.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Periodicals.</hi>&mdash;The <hi rend='italic'>Christian

<p>
A favorite project of Christian philanthropy with the Unitarians
has been the <q>ministry to the poor</q> in large cities and towns. They
have established such an institution in Boston, New York, Cincinnati,
Louisville, Providence, and elsewhere. In Boston, three large and

employed, by the aid of funds obtained from individual donors and
annual subscriptions from associations in the several churches of the

<head>Missionary Statistics.</head>

<p>
We have been much assisted in our missionary statistics by the
kindness of the secretaries of the several Missionary Boards, and by
permission of the proprietor, Mr. F. Rand, for the use of his valuable
Missionary Chart, prepared with great care, in 1840, by the Reverend
Messrs. Jefferson Hascall and Daniel Wise.
</p>

<p>
Those of the Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, and Episcopalians,
are brought down to 1841, and are quite accurate; but the
efforts of some of the other denominations in this great and glorious
cause are not fully stated, as some of the items have not been reported.

<head>First Protestant Missions.</head>

<p>
The first Protestant mission on record was undertaken in 1559, by
Michael, who was sent into Lapland by Gustavus Vasa, king of
Sweden.
</p>

<p>
John Eliot commenced the first mission to the Indians
at <hi rend='italic'>Nonantum</hi>,
now Newton, Massachusetts, in 1646. This mission gave rise to
a society in England for the propagation of the gospel in New England,
and to the formation of several other missionary stations; so that,
in 1696, there were thirty Indian churches in New England.
</p>

<p>
In 1705, Messrs. Ziegenbalg and Plutcho, under the auspices of
Frederick IV., king of Denmark, commenced a mission at Tranquebar,
in South Hindoostan, which was very successful. Its fruits continue
to the present time.
</p>

<p>
In 1728, a mission was begun by Schultze, at Madras, under the patronage
of the Christian Knowledge Society. In the following thirty-three
years, fourteen hundred and seventy converts united with the church.

<head>Moravian Missions.</head>

<p>
The Moravians trace their origin to the ninth century, when the
king of Moravia united with the Greek church.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>West Indian Mission.</hi>&mdash;The
Moravians commenced their mission
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
on the Island of St. Thomas in 1732. Its commencement was occasioned
by a conversation between a negro, named Anthony, and some
servants of Count Zinzendorf. The negro said he had a sister at St.
Thomas, who was deeply anxious to be instructed about religion.
This remark was repeated to one of <q>the <hi rend='italic'>brethren</hi>,</q>
named Leonard
Dober. He determined to visit St. Thomas, <q>even,</q> as he said, <q>if
he were obliged to sell himself for a slave to effect his purpose.</q> Dober
went; and though, for a time, little good was effected, yet, in 1736,
the Lord poured out his spirit, and many of the slaves were awakened.
There are now two stations on this island.
</p>

<p>
In 1734, they began their mission on the Island of St. Croix. It was
soon abandoned, but was reëstablished in 1740. In 1754, missions
were commenced on the Islands of St. Jan and Jamaica; in 1756, at
Antigua; in 1765, at Barbadoes; in 1777, at St. Christopher's; and at
Tobago in 1790.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Greenland Mission.</hi>&mdash;This was commenced in 1733, at New
Herrnhut, or Lusatia, by Matthew and Christian Stach, when the congregation
of the brethren at home amounted to but six hundred members.
They persevered through cold, hunger, and discouragement,
though for five years they had no conversions. Greenland is <emph>now</emph> a
Christian country.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>North American Indian
Missions.</hi>&mdash;These were begun in Georgia,
1735, among the Creeks, at the instigation of Count Zinzendorf.
It was followed by numerous other stations, many of which have since
become extinct.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>South American Missions.</hi>&mdash;Surinam,
a Dutch settlement in Guiana,
was the scene of their first operations here, about 1735 or 1738.
They began on the invitation of a planter. Several other settlements
were attempted, but were subsequently abandoned, for various causes.
In 1767, they commenced a prosperous station at Paramaribo.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Labrador Missions.</hi>&mdash;Supposing
that a natural affinity subsisted
between this people and the Greenlanders, the brethren commenced
their labors here in 1752. This attempt failed; but, in 1770, a settlement
was effected at Nain, by the agency of Messrs. Haven, Drachart,
and Jensen.

<head>London Missionary Society.</head>

<p>
The extensive and splendid missions of this board originated with
the Rev. David Bogue, while on a visit to London. From his suggestions,
the society was formed, in 1795, by several ministers of various
denominations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>South Sea Islands.</hi>&mdash;The
society commenced their labors among
these isles by sending out thirty-six missionaries, in 1796, who arrived
safely, and commenced their duties at Otaheite, Tongataboo, and St.
Christina, in March, 1797. Subsequently, they spread their influence
over nearly all the islands of the Pacific Ocean. These missions have
been eminently successful.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>New South Wales.</hi>&mdash;This mission was begun by the labors of
Mr. Threlkeld, in 1826, in Bahtabee, on Lake Macquaire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>South African Missions.</hi>&mdash;The
success of the missions in the
islands of the Pacific and South Seas, turned their attention to this
dark land. Dr. Vanderkemp, who was their first laborer, began his
labors on the River Keis Kamma, in Caffraria, in 1799. In 1801, he
removed to Graff Reinet, and preached to the Hottentots in that vicinity.
These missions afterwards spread very widely among the
Caffres and Hottentots.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>East Indian Missions.</hi>&mdash;The
society's missions in this most interesting
quarter of the globe were commenced at Calcutta and Chinsura,
by the Rev. Mr. Forsyth, in 1798. Subsequently, their stations spread
over Northern and Peninsular India, India beyond the Ganges, into
China, Siam, and some of the Asiatic Isles.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Guiana and West Indies</hi>.&mdash;At the request of a pious Dutch
planter, Mr. Wray was sent to Demerara, in Guiana, in 1807. This
was the beginning of the society's operations in South America.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Other Missions.</hi>&mdash;Beside
these, are the European and Mediterranean

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Education.</hi>&mdash;This
society has several presses distributed over the
vast field occupied by their agents, by means of which millions of
pages are annually scattered among the people. They publish tracts
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
parts of the Scriptures, &amp;c. &amp;c. They have also upwards of four
hundred native assistants, which are not mentioned in the following

<p>
Summary.
</p>

<p>
From the best accounts we can obtain, this society had, in 1840,
in Asia, the South Sea Islands, Africa, Guiana, and in Europe,
about five hundred and fifty missionary stations and out-stations, one
hundred and sixty-four missionaries, five thousand communicants, and
about twenty-five thousand scholars.

<head>American Board Of Foreign Missions.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in Asia.</hi>&mdash;The
news of the success of English missionary
enterprise, seconded by the zeal and influence of S. J. Mills, originated
the germ of the invaluable labors of this board, which was
organized in 1810. Their first missions were in Asia. Bombay was
the scene of their first labors, in the year 1813, and Messrs. Nott, Newell,
and Hall, their first missionaries. From Bombay they extended
their influence to Ceylon, in 1816; to China, and South-eastern Asia,
and to Siam, in 1830.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Mediterranean Missions.</hi>&mdash;These
missions were begun by sending
out Messrs. Parsons and Fisk on a voyage of research. The first
station occupied was Beyroot, in Syria, in 1823. To this, stations at
Malta, in Greece, at Constantinople, &amp;c., have been added.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions at the Sandwich Islands.</hi>&mdash;A special providence
marked the commencement of these missions. Two boys, named
Obookiah and Hopu, were, at their own request, brought to America.
This gave rise to a train of interesting circumstances, which led to the
commencement of the mission, in 1820, by Messrs. Bingham, Thurston,
and others. Vast success has attended this mission, especially
of late.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>North American Indian Missions.</hi>&mdash;These were commenced in
1816, among the Cherokees, by the Rev. C. Kingsbury. The Choctaws,
the Chickasaws, the Osages, and other tribes, have since shared
the labors of the board. The late unhappy removal of the Cherokee
nation has done much towards the prostration of missionary success
among that interesting but deeply-injured tribe.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in Africa.</hi>&mdash;The
efforts of the board in this quarter of
the globe are of recent date. Only seven years have elapsed since their
commencement. Some native towns on the western coast, and a numerous
aboriginal tribe called the Zulus, on the south-east shore, are
the chief objects of their labors at present. This field is considered very
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
promising, and it is confidently believed that its occupation will be one
effectual aid in the great work of regenerating that darkened, enslaved,
and degraded continent.
</p>

<p>
In 1841, this board had missions to the Zulus in South Africa, the
Grebos in West Africa, to Greece, to Turkey, Syria, the Nestorians
of Persia, the Independent Nestorians, the Persian Mahometans, to the
Mahrattas in Western India, to Madras and Madura in Southern India,
to Ceylon, Siam, China Singapore, Borneo, and to the Sandwich Islands.
</p>

<p>
They have missions to the Cherokee Indians, the Choctaws, Pawnees,
to the Oregon Indians, the Sioux, Ojibwas, Stockbridge Indians,
New York Indians, and to the Abenaquis.

<head>Presbyterian Board Of Foreign Missions.</head>

<p>
Until within a few years, this body of Christians united with the
American board in their operations among the heathen. A distinct
society, under the name of the <hi rend='italic'>Western
Foreign Missionary Society</hi>, was
formed in 1831, by the synod of Pittsburg, which was merged into the
present board in 1837.
</p>

<p>
Three of the missions of the board were begun by this society, namely,
the Western Africa, the Hindoostan, and Iowa and Sac missions.
</p>

<p>
This board is intending to reënforce its missions, and to occupy
several new stations, as soon as the requisite arrangements can be
made. Its main efforts will be directed towards Hindoostan, where it
has now two presses in active coöperation with its missionaries. This
denomination of Christians have the following missions:&mdash;Iowa
and Sac Indians; Chippewa and Ottawa Indians; Texas; Western
Africa, <hi rend='italic'>Kroos</hi>; Chinese,
<hi rend='italic'>Singapore</hi>; Siam; Northern India, <hi rend='italic'>Lodiana</hi>,

<p>
Summary.
</p>

<p>
This church has now under her care in the foreign field, fifty-seven
laborers sent from her own bosom, twenty-three of whom are ministers
of the gospel; besides eight native assistants, some of them men of
learning, all of them hopefully pious, and in different stages of preparation
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
and trial for the missionary work among their own benighted
people. Through the mission stations occupied by these brethren,
the church is brought in direct contact with five different heathen
nations, containing two thirds of the whole human race. Annual expenditure
about sixty-five thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
The Presbyterian Domestic Board of Missions employs or aids two
hundred and sixty missionaries and agents, who have under their charge
about twenty thousand communicants, and twenty thousand Sabbath
school scholars. Annual disbursements about thirty-five thousand

<head>English Baptist Missionary Society.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>East Indies.</hi>&mdash;A
mission was commenced at Serampore in 1793.
The English Baptists were just awakening to a sense of their responsibility
for the conversion of the world, when Dr. Thomas arrived in
London, to solicit missionary aid for Hindoostan. The society took
him under their patronage, and sent him back in company with Dr.
Cary. After laboring successfully in various places, in 1800 Dr. Cary
removed to Serampore, which thenceforward became a central station.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>West Indian Missions.</hi>&mdash;In 1814, a mulatto preacher, named
Baker, requested this society to send a missionary to Jamaica. In
compliance with this request, Mr. I. Rowe was sent out, who, after
laboring with pleasing success, died; and, in 1815, the society sent out
Mr. Compere and assistants, who established a mission in Kingston.
This was the origin of the Baptist missions in the West Indies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>South American Mission.</hi>&mdash;On
a representation to the society,
that much good might be done among the negro population and the
Indians in and around Honduras, in the Bay of Mexico, the society, in
1822, sent out Mr. J. Bourne, who succeeded in establishing a church
and congregation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>South African Mission.</hi>&mdash;In
1831, Rev. W. Davies was sent to

<p>
Summary.
</p>

<p>
This society have, in Asia, the Asiatic Islands, West Indies, South
America, and South Africa, one hundred and twenty-nine stations and

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in Asia.</hi>&mdash;Rev.
A. Judson may be said to be the father
of Baptist missions in this country, and, indeed, of the missionary
labors of this society. It was his conversion to the principles of the
Baptists, while a missionary of the American board in India, that
roused them to action. He commenced his labors under discouraging
circumstances, at Rangoon, in the Burman empire, 1813. Since then,
the operations of this board have become very extensive, embracing
immense portions of the Burman empire, Siam, &amp;c. Asia is their
principal mission field, and they have laid sure foundations for the
evangelization of many parts of that benighted clime.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Indian Missions.</hi>&mdash;An
impression, made, no doubt, by divine
influence, of the importance of missions to this people, led, in 1817,
to the appointment of J. M. Peck and J. E. Welch to be missionaries
to the North American Indians. J. M. Peck commenced their first
Indian mission among the Cherokees in 1818. Many tribes are now
embraced by the labors of the board, and although the progress of
truth has been slow among the <q>red men,</q> yet the board have cause
to rejoice over their Indian missions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>African Mission.</hi>&mdash;This
mission was commenced by the offer of
L. Cary and C. Teage, colored men, to become the messengers of
the churches in this work. They commenced their duties, in 1821, at
Liberia, where the board continues its efforts for the redemption of
Africa, with some success, chiefly among the Bassas.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>European Missions.</hi>&mdash;These
missions were commenced in 1832.
Professor Chase was sent to explore the kingdom of France, and the
Rev. J. C. Rostan commenced a course of evangelical demonstrations
at Paris; since which, Germany and Greece have shared the attention
of the board. These are missions of the first importance.
</p>

<p>
General Summary.

The Church of England has been actively engaged in missionary
operations since the year 1698, when the <q>Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge</q> was formed. In 1701, the <q>Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</q> was instituted. The
<q>Church Missionary Society</q> was established in 1800. These societies
are still in active and vigorous operation. They have missions in
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
every quarter of the globe, and their annual expenditures, for the propagation
of the Gospel, amount to about one million three hundred and
seventeen thousand three hundred and fifty-six dollars.
</p>

<p>
The Episcopal Church in the United States established a <hi rend='italic'>Domestic
and Foreign Missionary Society</hi> in 1820; and the General Convention
of 1835 resolved, That the Church itself was the missionary society
and that every member of the Church, by baptism, was, of course, bound
to support her missions. The missionary field was declared to
be <hi rend='smallcaps'>the world</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>domestic missions</hi> being those established within the territory
of the United States, and <hi rend='italic'>foreign missions</hi>
those without that territory.
At each triennial meeting of the General Convention, a Board of Missions,
consisting of about one hundred members, is selected from the
different dioceses. This Board has the general supervision of all the
missionary operations of the Church; and meets annually, or oftener,
if necessary.
</p>

<p>
There are two standing committees of this Board,&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>Committee
for Domestic Missions</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Committee for Foreign
Missions</hi>, to whom, during the recess of the Board, the care and management of the
missions is confided. This Society now has under its charge one hundred
and forty-five domestic, and twelve foreign stations, employing
eighty-five domestic and eleven foreign missionaries, and also eighteen
teachers and assistants in the foreign stations.
</p>

<p>
The expenditures of this Board, for the year 1841, were sixty-one
thousand five hundred and eighty-six dollars and thirty-seven cents.
This Society has missionary stations in Athens, Crete, Constantinople,
China, (Maca,) Cape Palmas and other stations in Western Africa,
and in Texas.

<head>Society For Propagating The Gospel Among
The Indians And Others.</head>

<p>
This society derived its origin among the Puritans, in England, in
1648. The charter under which it now acts was granted by the legislature
of Massachusetts, in 1687. Its list of past and present members
in 1840, comprised one hundred and twenty-five names of the most
eminent divines, jurists, and laymen in Massachusetts, in which state
the operations of the society are chiefly confined. The funds of this
society, in 1840, amounted to thirty-six thousand three hundred and
eighty-seven dollars, the income of which is annually expended for
the <q>propagation of the gospel</q> among the needy and destitute.

<head>Wesleyan Or English Methodist Missionary
Society.</head>

<p>
Scarcely had Mr. Wesley raised the standard of Methodism in
England, before he turned his attention to the wants of other lands.
America presenting a vast field for missionary labor, he sent over
Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmore, in 1769. These were the first
Methodist missionaries. From their labors the Methodist Episcopal
church in the United States gradually came into being. Dr. Coke
was preëminently useful in establishing missions in various places
This society was organized in 1817.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>West Indies.</hi>&mdash;A
peculiar providence marked the commencement
of this mission. Dr. Coke, with three preachers, was proceeding to
Nova Scotia, in September, 1786, but was driven, by stress of weather,
to Antigua. Finding a number of serious persons there, he preached
Jesus to them, and by his labors laid the foundation for extensive
missions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>British North America.</hi>&mdash;About
1779, several Methodist emigrants
were the means of awakening many souls. Among these was
Mr. Black, who, after laboring for some time with zeal and success,
was appointed the superintendent of the mission in British North
America. This mission embraces Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada,
Newfoundland, and Honduras.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in Asia.</hi>&mdash;The
plan of establishing missions in Asia originated
with Dr. Coke; and, in 1813, he sailed, with Messrs. Harvard,
Clough, Ault, Erskine, Squance, and Lynch, for Ceylon. Unfortunately,
he died on the passage. The brethren, after many trials,
reached Ceylon, and commenced their labors at Jaffna, Batticaloa, and
Matura. From Ceylon, the society directed its attention to continental
India, where their labors have become very extensive.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in South Africa.</hi>&mdash;These
missions were begun in 1816,
by Rev. Barnabas Shaw, among the Namaquas, a tribe of Hottentots.
These missions have subsequently spread over large portions of this
benighted land.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in the South Seas.</hi>&mdash;These missions include the
Friendly Isles, New Zealand, New South Wales, &amp;c. They were
commenced at the latter place, in 1815, by Mr. Leigh, who began his
duties and labors at Sydney, with favorable auspices and good success.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in the Mediterranean.</hi>&mdash;These were commenced in
Gibraltar, in 1804, by Mr. McMullen, who died a few days after beginning
his labors. The mission was then suspended until 1808, when
Mr. William Griffith was appointed to its charge. Besides this mission,
the Methodists have stations at Malta, Alexandria, and Zanto.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Missions in Europe.</hi>&mdash;These
missions embrace the labors of the
society in Sweden, France, Germany, Ireland, and the Norman and

by the various pastors and churches of the surrounding country, under
the encouragement of Dr. Steinkopff. The scene of their first labors
was among the German colonies in Asiatic Russia, in 1822, when
seven missionaries were sent to prepare the way of the Lord in that
important field. Others followed, and their mission was beginning to
promise great results, when, in 1837, by a
<foreign rend='italic'>ukase</foreign> from the emperor of

In 1828, they commenced a mission at Liberia. Death became their
opponent here, and seven of their missionaries died through the sickliness
of the climate. Two missionaries are still laboring in that field.
</p>

<p>
They have seven missionaries in Hindoostan, who occupy two stations,&mdash;Mangalore

<head>John Wickliffe.</head>

<p>
A celebrated doctor, professor of divinity at Oxford, and
deservedly considered as the forerunner of Luther in the
reformation. He was born at Wickliffe, in Yorkshire, about
1324, and educated at Queen's College, and afterwards at
Merton, and in 1361 raised to the mastership of Baliol College.
In 1365, he was made, by the scholars, head of Canterbury
Hall, just founded at Oxford by Archbishop Islip; but
his elevation was opposed by the monks, and Langham, the
next primate; and the pope, to whom the dispute was referred,
displaced him and his secular associates. Thus disgraced
by violence, he retired to his living at Lutterworth, in
Leicestershire, meditating revenge against the authors of his
unjust privation. In the works of Marsilius of Padua, and
other bold writers, he found ample room to indulge his opposition;
and, well aware of the popularity of attacking a
foreign power, which overawed the throne, and submitted the
industry and the revenues of the kingdom to its own avaricious
views, he loudly inveighed against the errors and the
encroachments of the Romish church. His writings alarmed
the clergy, and a council was assembled at Lambeth, by
Archbishop Sudbury, 1377, and Wickliffe summoned to give
an account of his doctrines. He appeared before it, accompanied
by the duke of Lancaster, then in power; and he
made so able a defence, that he was dismissed without condemnation.
<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>
His acquittal, however, displeased the pope,
Gregory XI., who directed his emissaries to seize the offending
heretic, or, if he were protected by the great and powerful
of the kingdom, to cite him to Rome, to answer in person
before the sovereign pontiff. In consequence of this, a second
council assembled at Lambeth, and the nineteen propositions,
which the pope had declared heretical, were so ably
vindicated by the eloquence of the undaunted reformer, that
his judges, afraid of offending the nobles, or of exciting a
commotion among the people, who loudly supported the cause
of their champion, permitted him to depart in safety, and enjoined
on him silence in matters of religion and of controversy.
Undismayed by the power of his enemies, Wickliffe continued
to preach his doctrines, which were now more universally
spread; and a third council, therefore, assembled, under
Courtnay, the primate, 1382, and twenty-four propositions of
the reformer were condemned as heretical, and fourteen as
erroneous. The severity of the church was, at the suggestion
of the pope, and the concurrence of the weak Richard II.,
directed with effect against the supporters of the new
heresy; but, while some of his followers suffered punishment
for their adherence to his principles, Wickliffe unhappily
died at Lutterworth, 1384, at a time when nothing was
wanting to emancipate the English nation from the tyranny
of Rome, but the boldness, perseverance, and eloquence, of
a popular leader. Of the several works which he wrote, his
Trialogus is almost the only one which has been printed.
The noble struggle which Wickliffe had made against the
gigantic power of Rome was almost forgotten after his death,
till Martin Luther arose to follow his steps, and to establish
his doctrines on a foundation which will last till Christianity
is no more. The memory of Wickliffe was branded with
ignominy by the impotent Papists, and by the order of the
council of Constance, whose cruelties towards John Huss
and Jerome of Prague are so well known, the illustrious reformer
was declared to have died an obstinate heretic; and
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>
his bones were therefore dug up from holy ground, and contemptuously
burnt.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Jerome of Prague.</head>

<p>
The celebrated lay reformer was born at Prague, about the
year 1370. Very little is extant relative to the early part
of his life; but he was very eager in the pursuit of knowledge,
and spent his youth in the universities of Prague, Paris, Heidelberg,
Cologne, and Oxford. At the latter university, he
became acquainted with the works of Wickliffe, translated
them into his native language, professed himself, on his return
to Prague, to be an open favorer of him, and attached himself
to the Reformed in Bohemia, over whom Huss presided. Before
the council of Constance, Jerome was cited on the 17th
of April, 1415, when Huss was confined at that place. On
his arrival, he found that he could not render any assistance
to Huss, and therefore thought it prudent to retire; and, on
behalf of Huss, he wrote to the emperor. At Kirsaw, Jerome
was seized by an officer of the duke of Sulzbach, who immediately
wrote to the council concerning him, and they
directed him to send his prisoner to Constance. On his
arrival at that place, he was immediately brought before the
council, accused of his attachment to Protestant principles,
and was remanded from the assembly into a dungeon. As he
was there sitting, ruminating on his approaching fate, he heard
a voice calling out in these words:&mdash;<q>Fear not, Jerome,
to die in the cause of that truth which, during thy life, thou
hast defended.</q> It was the voice of Madderwitz, who had
contributed to the comfort of Huss; but, in consequence of
it, Jerome was conveyed to a strong tower, and exposed to
torture and want.
</p>

<p>
This suffering brought on him a dangerous illness, and
attempts were then made to induce him to retract his principles;
but he remained immovable. Unhappily, however, for
his subsequent peace of mind, he was at length induced to
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
retract, and acknowledged the errors of Wickliffe and Huss,
assented to the condemnation of the latter, and declared
himself a firm believer in the church of Rome. But the
conscience of Jerome would not allow him to suffer that
retraction to remain; and he accordingly recanted, and
demanded a second trial.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, in the month of May, 1416, Jerome was
again called before the council, and charged with his adherence
to the errors of Wickliffe, his having had a picture
of him in his chamber, his denial of transubstantiation, with
other matters of a similar description. On these articles he
answered with equal spirit. Through the whole oration he
manifested an amazing strength of memory. His voice was
sweet, distinct, and full. Firm and intrepid, he stood before
the council; collected in himself, and not only despising, but
seeming even desirous of death.
</p>

<p>
His speech did not, however, excite pity; and he was
delivered over to the civil power for martyrdom. When
surrounded by blazing fagots, he cried out, <q>O Lord God,
have mercy upon me!</q> and a little afterwards, <q>Thou
knowest how I have loved thy truth.</q> With cheerful countenance
he met his fate; and, observing the executioner about
to set fire to the wood behind his back, he cried out, <q>Bring
thy torch hither: perform thy office before my face. Had I
feared death, I might have avoided it.</q> As the wood began
to blaze, he sang a hymn, which the violence of the flames
did not interrupt.
</p>

<p>
Jerome was, unquestionably, an excellent man. His
Christianity must have been sincere, thus to have supported
him; and the uniform tenor of his virtuous life corroborated
the truth of that opinion. His temper was mild
and affable, and the relations of life he supported with great
piety and benevolence. He was a light set upon a hill; and
though for a few moments it was obscured and darkened, yet
it again burst forth, and continued to shine with splendor and
advantage.

<head>John Huss.</head>

<p>
A famous divine and martyr, born in Bohemia, 1376, and educated
at Prague, where he took his degrees, and entered
into the ministry. The writings of Wickliffe converted him
from the superstitions of Rome, and, with eloquent zeal, he
began to preach against the power and influence of the pope.
His efforts proved successful; the Papal authority began to
be slighted in Bohemia; but the archbishop of Prague issued
two mandates against the heresies of Wickliffe, and the labors
of Huss and his followers; and this exertion of power was
soon seconded by a bull from Rome, for the suppression of
all tenets offensive to the holy see. Huss exclaimed against
these proceedings, and, though summoned to Rome to answer
for his conduct, he, supported by the favor of Wenceslaus,
king of Bohemia, disregarded the pope's authority, and
was excommunicated; and, soon after, his friends and adherents
were included in the same interdict. After causing,
by his opposition to the Papal decrees, various tumults in
Prague and Bohemia, Huss was prevailed upon to appear at
the council of Constance, to give an account of his doctrines.
The emperor Sigismund granted him his protection, and insured
security to his person; but when, soon after, he reached
Constance, 1414, he was seized as a heretic, and imprisoned,
and, after a confinement of severe hardships for six months,
he was condemned without a hearing; and, when he refused
to recant his errors, he was tumultuously sentenced to be
burnt. The emperor indeed complained of the contempt
shown to his authority, and of the perfidy used towards the
delinquent, but all in vain. Huss was inhumanly dragged to
execution; he was stripped of his sacerdotal habit, deprived
of his degrees, and, with a paper crown on his head, with
pictures of devils round, and the inscription of <q>Heresiarch,</q>
he was burned alive, July, 1415. He endured his torments
with uncommon fortitude and truly Christian resignation.
His ashes were collected, and then sprinkled in the Rhine.

<head>John Œcolampadius.</head>

<p>
An eminent German reformer, born, in 1482, at Weinsberg
in Franconia. He was converted to the Protestant
faith by reading the works of Luther; became professor
of theology at Basle; embraced the opinions of Zuinglius
respecting the sacrament; contributed much to the progress

<head>Martin Luther.</head>

<p>
The celebrated reformer was born at Isleben, in Saxony, 10th
November, 1483. His parents wished him to devote himself
to the labors of the bar, but an extraordinary accident diverted
his purpose. As he walked one day in the fields with a
fellow-student, he was struck down by lightning, and his
companion killed by his side; and this had such effect upon
his mind that, without consulting his friends, he retired from
the world, into the order of the Augustines. In this seclusion
he found by accident a Latin Bible, which he never before
had seen, and in perusing it he was astonished at the little
knowledge of Scripture and of Christianity which the clergy
then imparted to the people. From the convent of Erfurt
he was removed to Wittemberg University; and here he read
lectures on philosophy, for three years, to numerous and applauding
audiences. The completion of St. Peter's Church
at Rome at this time required extraordinary sums, and the
pope, Leo X., to fill his coffers with greater facility, published
general indulgences for the forgiveness of sins to such as
would contribute to the pious work. The Dominicans were
intrusted with the selling of these indulgences in Germany,
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>
and in paying their money the good friar Tetzel informed
the superstitious people that they might release themselves
not only from past, but also future sins. This pious imposition
did not escape the discerning eye of Luther; he
published, in 1517, a thesis, containing ninety-five propositions
on indulgences, and challenged opposition. Tetzel was not
silent on the occasion; but while he, with the voice of authority,
called his opponent a damnable heretic, and whilst he
burnt the thesis with all possible ignominy, Luther asserted
boldly the inefficacy of indulgences, and regarded penitence
and works of mercy and charity alone capable of forming a
reconciliation with Heaven. Though attacked by numbers,
Luther had the satisfaction to see his sentiments embraced
with eagerness by the body of the people; and, when summoned
by the pope to appear at Rome to answer for his
conduct, he had the firmness to refuse, though he, at the same
time, in the most submissive manner, exculpated himself, and
deprecated the resentment of the supreme pontiff. Maximilian,
the emperor, was anxious to support the cause of Rome;
but Luther happily found a protector and friend in the elector
of Saxony, and, upon an assurance of personal safety, he did
not refuse to appear at Augsburg before the Papal legate,
Cajetan. The conference ended by the refusal of Luther to
submit implicitly to the pleasure of the Papal see. The pope,
however, finding that violence could not destroy the obstinacy
of Luther, had recourse to milder means, and his agent Miltitius
was employed to visit the reformer, to argue with him,
and to offer terms of reconciliation. Luther was struck with
the civilities and the temper of the Papal missionary; but,
instead of making submission, he was roused to greater opposition
by the exhortations of the Bohemians, and the able
support of Melancthon, Carolostadius, and other learned men.
In 1519, he was engaged in a personal controversy at Leipsic
with Eccius, divinity professor at Ingolstadt; but it tended
only to sow greater enmity and deeper variance between the
disputants. The same year, his book against indulgences was
censured by the divines of Louvaine and Cologne; but Luther
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>
disregarded their opinions, and appealed for protection to the
new emperor, Charles V. Though he had written, at the
suggestion of Miltitius, a letter to the pope, not indeed of
submission, but rather of exculpation, in language bold and
energetic, he was in 1520 formally condemned by a bull from
Rome, which, after enumerating forty-one of his heretical
opinions, denounces against him the vengeance of the church,
and excommunication, if within sixty days he did not make
a due submission. This violent conduct Luther answered by
<q>The Captivity of Babylon,</q> a book in which he inveighed
bitterly against the abuses of Rome; and then, calling the
students of Wittemberg together, he flung into the fire the
offensive decree, which he called the
<hi rend='italic'>execrable bull of Antichrist</hi>.
In 1521, he was summoned to appear before the
emperor at the diet of Worms, with a promise of protection;
and, though his friends dissuaded him, and told him that, as
his opponents had burned his writings, so they would treat
him after the manner of Huss, he declared, with fearless
voice, <q>If I knew there were as many devils at Worms as
tiles on the houses, I would go.</q> At Worms he was required
by Eccius to retract his opinions; but he declared that, except
what he advanced could be proved contrary to Scripture, he
neither could nor would recant. His obstinacy proved offensive
to the emperor; but, as he had promised him his protection,
he permitted him to depart. Charles, nevertheless, published
his edict against him and his adherents, and placed him under
the ban of the empire. Luther, however, remained secure
under the protection of the elector, who had thus effected his
deliverance, and in the castle of Wittemberg, which he denominated
his <hi rend='italic'>hermitage</hi> and his
<hi rend='italic'>Palmos</hi>, he held a secret
correspondence with his friends, or composed books in defence
of his opinions. At the end of ten months, when the emperor
was departed for Flanders, he again appeared publicly at
Wittemberg, and had the satisfaction to find that, instead of
being checked, his doctrines had gained ground, and were
universally embraced through Germany. In 1522, he published,
in conjunction with Melancthon, a Latin translation
<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>
of the New Testament; and the work was read with avidity
by the German nation. In 1524, he had to contend with
Erasmus, a man who had apparently adopted his sentiments,
though he had not the manliness to acknowledge them; and
he now found in him an able antagonist enlisted in defence
of the pope. In 1524, Luther threw aside the monastic habit;
and the next year he married Catherine de Bore, a nun who
had escaped from a convent; and though he was ridiculed
by his enemies, and censured for taking a young wife, he
defended his conduct by scriptural texts, and again set at
nought the authority of Rome and the cavils of her advocates.
In 1525, the emperor called a diet at Spires, in consequence
of the war with the Turks, as well as the troubled state of
Germany in consequence of religious disputes; and in the
sitting of the next year he proposed that the edict of Worms
should be duly enforced, the Catholic religion supported, and
heretics punished. The new doctrines, though thus openly
attacked by the head of the empire, were ably defended by the
electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, the landgrave of Hesse,
the prince of Anhalt, and others; and in another diet, held
again at Spires, these dissentient princes protested against the
measures of the empire, and were consequently called <hi rend='italic'>Protestants</hi>.
In the midst of the confusion of Germany, a confession
of faith was drawn up by Melancthon, the mildest and most
moderate of Luther's followers, and, as it was presented to the
emperor at Augsburg, it has been called the <hi rend='italic'>Augsburg
Confession</hi>. Thus the opposition raised against the mighty empire
of spiritual Rome by an obscure monk, was supported by
intelligent princes and powerful nations, and Luther, now
regarded as the champion of the faith through Germany, had
nothing to apprehend from his persecutors, but had only to
labor earnestly to confirm what had been so happily established.
His German translation of the Bible appeared in
1535, and was received with grateful raptures by the Germans.
He died at Isleben, 18th February, 1546, aged 63. This
illustrious man, engaged, as Atterbury has observed, against
the united forces of the Papal world, stood the shock with
<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>
bravery and success. He was a man of high endowments of
mind, and great virtues. He had a vast understanding, which
raised him to a pitch of learning unknown in the age in which
he lived. His works, collected after his death, appeared at
Wittemberg, in seven volumes, folio.

<head>Ulriucus Zuinglius.</head>

<p>
A zealous reformer, born at Wildehausen, in Switzerland, 1487.
He studied the learned languages at Bâsle and Berne, and
applied himself to philosophy at Vienna, and took his degree
of doctor of divinity, at Bâsle, 1505. For ten years he acquired
popularity as public preacher at Glaris, and in 1516
he was invited to Zurich to undertake the office of minister.
The tenets of Luther, which were now propagated in Germany,
encouraged the Swiss preacher to oppose the sale of
indulgences, and to regard them as impositions from the
court of Rome upon the superstitious credulity of the people.
Undaunted in the publication of his opinions, he continued
to increase the number of his adherents, and in 1523 he
assembled the senate and the clergy of Zurich, and presented
before them in sixty-seven propositions the minute articles
of his faith. Though opposed by the bishop of Constance,
his doctrines were adopted by the full senate, and he was
exhorted to preach the word of God, whilst all pastors were
forbidden to teach any thing but what could be proved by
the gospel. Another synod still more powerfully favored the
cause of Zuinglius and of truth; images and relics were
removed from churches, processions were forbidden, and the
greater part of the outward worship and ceremonies of the
church of Rome was abolished. While, however, successful
in the establishment of his doctrines in the canton of Zurich,
Zuinglius met with violent opposition in the other members
of the Swiss confederacy, and, after the fruitless conferences
of Baden between Œcolampadius on the part of Zurich, and
of Eckius on the part of the Catholics, both sides had recourse
<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>
to arms. In one of the first encounters, the great champion
of the reformation was slain, 11th October, 1531. As a
leader, Zuinglius displayed great firmness, deep learning, and
astonishing presence of mind. Though he opposed the doctrines
of the Romish church, he greatly differed from the
German reformer, and each, unhappily, paid little respect to
the opinions of the other. His followers continued to increase;
and in bearing his name they maintained doctrines
on original sin, and on grace, which were rejected by the
other seceders from the jurisdiction of Rome. According to
Zuinglius, salvation was extended not only to infants, who
died before baptism, but to heathens of a virtuous and moral
life. Some alterations were afterwards introduced by Calvin,
by Beza, and others; but whilst the proselytes to these new
opinions acquired the name of <hi rend='italic'>Calvinists</hi> in France, and in
other parts of Europe, the Zuinglians, who firmly adhered to
the tenets of their founder, assumed the appellation
of <hi rend='italic'>Sacramentarians</hi>.
The works of Zuinglius, as a controversialist,
were respectable, chiefly written in German, and were comprehended
in four volumes, folio.

<head>Martin Bucer.</head>

<p>
A Dominican, born in Alsace, in 1491, who early embraced
the tenets of Luther. He afterwards inclined more to the
opinions of Zuinglius, and, in his zeal for the reformation,
attempted in vain to reconcile these two powerful leaders.
For twenty years, his eloquence was exerted at Strasburg to
establish the Protestant cause; but the turbulence of the times,
and his opposition to the views of the Catholics at Augsburg,
rendered him unpopular, so that he received with pleasure
the invitations of Cranmer to settle in England. He was
received with gratitude by the nation. Edward VI. treated
him with great kindness, and he was appointed theological
professor at Cambridge, in 1549, where he died two years
after. Five years after, the persecutions of Mary were extended
<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>
to his remains, which were ignominiously burned; but
the insult was repaired by the good sense of Elizabeth. In
learning, judgment, and moderation, Bucer was inferior to
none of the great reformers, and, with Melancthon, he may
be considered as the best calculated to restore and maintain
unanimity among contending churches and opposite sects.
His writings, in Latin and German, were very numerous, and
all on theological subjects.

<head>Philip Melancthon.</head>

<p>
A celebrated reformer, born 16th February, 1497, at Bretten,
in the Palatinate of the Rhine. His father's name was
Schwartserdt, which signifies <hi rend='italic'>black earth</hi>; but the word was
changed, according to the affectation of the times, by his
friend Reuchlin, into Melancthon, which, in Greek, expresses
the same meaning. He studied at Bretten, Pfortsheim, and
Heidelberg, and with such success that, at thirteen, he wrote
a comedy of some merit. He left Heidelberg in 1512, because
he was refused a degree on account of his youth, and
then passed to Tubingen, where he resided for six years, and
gave public lectures on Virgil, Terence, and other classics.
In 1518, by the recommendation of his friend Reuchlin, he
was appointed, by the elector of Saxony, Greek professor at
Wittemberg; and here began that intimacy with Luther,
which contributed so much to the progress of the reformation.
He was, in 1527, appointed by his patron, the duke, to
visit the churches of the electorate, and afterwards he was
employed in the arduous labors of preparing those articles of
faith which have received the name of the Augsburg Confession,
because presented to the emperor at the diet of that
city. In the disputes which he maintained in those days of
controversial enmity, he displayed great candor and mildness,
which his friend Luther attributed more to a spirit of timidity,
than to the meekness of the Christian character. His moderation,
as well as his learning, was so universally acknowledged,
that he received a liberal invitation from Francis I. to
<pb n='362'/><anchor id='Pg362'/>
come to France, to settle the disputes of the Protestants; but
through the interference of the duke of Saxony, the offer was
declined, as likewise a similar invitation from the king of
England. He was engaged in the various conferences which
took place on religious subjects at Frankfort, Reinspurg,
Worms, Spires, and Ratisbon, and every where evinced the
deepest learning, the most peaceable temper, and the strongest
moderation. The character of the times, and not inclination,
rendered him a controversialist, and his answer to his mother
displayed the great and the good man. When asked by the
aged woman, who repeated before him her prayers in a simple
but pious manner, what she must believe in this great confusion
of creeds; he replied, <q>Go on, mother, to believe and
pray as you have done, and never trouble yourself about
controversies.</q> He died at Wittemberg, 19th April, 1560,
and was buried by the side of his friend Luther, in the church
of the castle. Among the reasons which, on his death-bed,
he assigned for considering dissolution as happiness, he said
that it delivered him from theological persecutions. His
works were very numerous, and, as they were written in the
midst of controversy and ecclesiastical avocations, they were
not always so correct in language, as they proved useful in
advancing the reformation. A chronological catalogue of
these was published in 1582, and they appeared altogether in
four volumes, folio, at Wittemberg, 1601.

A celebrated reformer and theologian, whose real name was

an Augustine monk, and became an eminent preacher, and
prior of St. Fridian's, at Lucca. Having, however, embraced
the Protestant doctrines, he found it necessary to quit his
native country. After having been for some time professor
of divinity at Strasburg, he was invited to England, and appointed
professor of theology at Oxford. He left England
on the accession of Mary, and died in 1561, theological
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>

with Zuinglius, to whom he succeeded as pastor of Zurich.
He was one of the authors of the Helvetic Confession, and
assisted Calvin in drawing up the formulary of 1549. Bullinger
was a moderate and conscientious man; and it is much
to his honor that, on the ground of its being inconsistent with
Christianity for any one to hire himself out to slaughter those
who had never injured him, he successfully opposed a treaty
for supplying France with a body of Swiss mercenaries. He
died in 1575. His printed works form ten folio volumes.

<head>John Knox.</head>

<p>
The great champion of the Scottish reformation was born, in
1505, at Gifford, in East Lothian, and was educated at
Haddington and St. Andrews. After he was created master of
arts, he taught philosophy, most probably as a regent in one
of the colleges of the university. His class became celebrated,
and he was considered as equalling, if not excelling,
his master in the subtilties of the dialectic art. About the
same time, although he had no interest but what was procured
by his own merit, he was advanced to clerical orders, and
ordained a priest before he reached the age fixed by the canons
of the church. At this time, the fathers of the Christian
church, Jerome and Augustine, attracted his particular attention.
By the writings of the former, he was led to the
Scriptures as the only pure fountain of divine truth, and
instructed in the utility of studying them in the original
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>
languages. In the works of the latter he found religious
sentiments very opposite to those taught in the Romish
church, who, while she retained his name as a saint in her
calendar, had banished his doctrine as heretical from her
pulpits. From this time he renounced the study of scholastic
theology; and, although not yet completely emancipated from
superstition, his mind was fitted for improving the means
which Providence had given for leading him to a fuller and
more comprehensive view of the system of evangelical religion.
It was about the year 1535, when this favorable change commenced;
but it does not appear that he professed himself a
Protestant before the year 1542. He was converted from the
Romish faith by Wishart, and became a zealous preacher of
the new doctrines. Having been compelled to take shelter
in the castle of St. Andrews, he fell into the hands of the
French in July, 1547, and was carried with the garrison to
France, where he remained a captive on board of the galleys
till 1549. Subsequent to his liberation, he was for a short
time chaplain to Edward VI., after which he visited Geneva
and Frankfort, and, in 1555, returned to his native country.
After having for twelve months labored actively and successfully
to strengthen the Protestant cause in Scotland, he revisited
Geneva, where he remained till 1559. During his
residence in Geneva, he published his <q>First Blast of the
Trumpet against the monstrous Government of Women</q>&mdash;a
treatise which was levelled against Mary of England, but
which gave serious offence to Elizabeth. From April, 1559,
when he once more and finally set foot on Scottish earth, till
his decease, which took place November 24, 1572, the reformed
church was triumphant, and he was one of its most
prominent, admired, and honored leaders.
</p>

<p>
When his body was laid in the grave, the regent of Scotland
emphatically pronounced his eulogium, in the well-known
words, <q>There lies he who never feared the face of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
Knox has been styled the intrepid reformer; and that
character he unquestionably deserves. In personal intrepidity
and popular eloquence he resembled Luther. His
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>
doctrinal sentiments were those of Calvin; and, like Zuinglius,
he felt an attachment to the principles of religious liberty.
He effected much in the great work of the reformation; but his
manners were so severe, and his temper so acrid, that whilst he
may be equally respected with Luther and Melancthon, he is
not equally beloved. Knox was, however, known and beloved
by the principal persons among the reformed in France, Switzerland,
and Germany; and the affectionate veneration in
which his memory was held in Scotland after his death,
evinced that the influence he possessed among his countrymen,
during his life, was not constrained, but founded on the
high opinion which they entertained. Banatyne has thus
drawn his character, and it is unquestionably entitled to
consideration:&mdash;<q>In this manner,</q> says he, <q>departed this man
of God; the light of Scotland, the comfort of the church
within the same, the mirror of godliness, and pattern and
example to all true ministers, in purity of life, soundness of
doctrine, and boldness in reproving of wickedness; one that
cared not for the favor of men, how great soever they were.</q>

<head>John Calvin.</head>

<p>
A celebrated reformer, born at Noyon, in Picardy, 10th July,
1509. His family name was <hi rend='italic'>Cauvin</hi>, which he Latinized into
<hi rend='italic'>Calvinus</hi>. He was first intended for the church, and,
subsequently, for the profession of civil law. Having embraced
the principles of Protestantism, he was under the necessity
of quitting France; and he settled at Bâsle, where he published
his celebrated <q>Institutions of the Christian Religion.</q>
After having visited Italy, he was returning by the way of
Geneva, in 1536, when Farel and other reformers induced
him to take up his abode in that city. He was chosen one
of the ministers of the gospel, and professor of divinity. A
dispute with the city authorities soon compelled him to leave
Geneva, and he withdrew to Strasburg; whence he was recalled
in 1541. From the time of his recall, he possessed
almost absolute power at Geneva; and he exerted himself
<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>
vigorously in establishing the Presbyterian form of church
government. The reformer, who so loudly exclaimed against
the tyranny of Rome, directed the whole torrent of his
persecution against Servetus, a physician, who had in an
ambiguous style written upon the Trinity; and his vengeance
was not appeased till the unfortunate heretic had expired in
the flames. He died May 26, 1564; and, though he had
long enjoyed a high reputation and exercised an unbounded
authority, he left only three hundred crowns to his heirs,
including his library, the books of which sold afterwards at
a great price. The works of Calvin were printed in twelve
volumes, folio, Geneva, and in nine, Amsterdam, in 1667.

<p>
one of the most eminent of the reformers, was born at Vezelai,
in the Nivernois, in 1519, and was originally a Catholic,
and intended for the law. At the age of twenty, he
gained an unenviable reputation by the composition of Latin
poetry which was at once elegant and licentious, and which,
some years afterwards, he published under the title of <q>Juvenile
Poems.</q> Though not in orders, he possessed benefices of
<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>
considerable value. These, however, he abandoned in 1548,
and retired to Geneva, where he publicly abjured Popery.
To this he was induced by his having meditated, during illness,
upon the doctrines which he had heard from his Protestant
tutor, Melchior Wolmar; and perhaps also, in some
measure, by his attachment to a lady, whom he carried with
him to Geneva, and married. He now accepted the Greek
professorship at Lausanne, which he held for ten years. It
was while he was thus occupied that he produced his tragedy
of <q>Abraham's Sacrifice,</q> his version of the New Testament,
and his hateful defence of the right of the magistrate to punish
heretics. In 1559, he removed to Geneva, and became
the colleague of Calvin, through whom he was appointed
rector of the academy, and theological professor. Two years
after this, he took a prominent part in the conference at Poissy,
and was present at the battle of Dreux. He returned to
Geneva in 1563, succeeded Calvin in his offices and influence,
and was thenceforward considered as the head of the Calvinistic
church. After an exceedingly active life, he died on
the 13th of October, 1605.

gained him an honorable place in the council, and with signal
ability he exposed the sophistry of those who pleaded on
the side of Arius. Six months after, he was appointed the
successor of Alexander. Notwithstanding the influence of
the emperor, who had recalled Arius from banishment, and,
upon a plausible confession of his faith, in which he affected
to be Orthodox in his sentiments, directed that he should be
received by the Alexandrian church, Athanasius refused to
admit him to communion, and exposed his prevarication.
The Arians upon this exerted themselves to raise tumults at
Alexandria, and to injure the character of Athanasius with
the emperor, who was prevailed upon by falsehoods to
pronounce against him a sentence of banishment. In the beginning
<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>
of the reign of Constantius, he was recalled to his happy
people, but was again disturbed and deposed through the
influence of the Arians. Accusations were also sent against
him and other bishops from the east to the west; but they
were acquitted by Pope Julius in full council. Athanasius
was restored a second time to his see, upon the death of the
Arian bishop, who had been placed in it. Arianism, however,
being in favor at court, he was condemned by a council convened
at Arles, and by another at Milan, and was a third
time obliged to fly into the deserts. His enemies pursued
him even here, and set a price upon his head. In this situation,
Athanasius composed writings full of eloquence to
strengthen the faith of believers, and expose the falsehood of
his enemies. He returned with the other bishops whom
Julian the Apostate recalled from banishment, and, in A. D.
362, held a council at Alexandria, where the belief of a consubstantial
Trinity was openly professed. Many now were
recovered from Arianism, and brought to subscribe the
Nicene creed. But his peace was again interrupted by the
complaints of the heathen, whose temples the zeal of Athanasius
kept always empty. He was again obliged to fly to save
his life. The accession of Jovian brought him back. During
the reign of Jovian, also, Athanasius held another council,
which declared its adherence to the Nicene faith; and with
the exception of a short retirement under Valens, he was
permitted to sit down in quiet and govern his affectionate
church of Alexandria, until his death, in 373. Of the forty-six
years of his official life, he spent twenty in banishment.

<p>
Athanasius (says the Encyclopedia Americana) is one of
the greatest men of whom the church can boast. His deep
mind, his noble heart, his invincible courage, his living faith,
his unbounded benevolence, sincere humility, lofty eloquence,
and strictly virtuous life, gained the honor and love of all.
In all his writings, his style is distinguished for clearness and
moderation.

<head>Moses Maimonides.</head>

<p>
Moses son of Maimon, commonly called Moses Egypticus,
because physician to the sultan of Egypt, was a Jewish rabbi,
born at Cordova, in Spain, 1131. He opened a school in
Egypt, and as his skill, not only in languages, but in all
branches of science and of philosophy, was very great, his instructions
were attended by numerous and respectable pupils.
Thus eminently distinguished as a scholar, as a physician,
and also as a divine, so as to be called inferior only to the
legislator Moses, he beheld with indifference, and even
contempt, the fables and traditions of his countrymen, and
applied all the powers of learning, and the vast resources of
his mind, in the cause of truth, virtue, and philosophy. Some
of his works were written in Arabic, but are extant now in
Hebrew only. The most famous of these are his Commentaries
on the Misna; Jad, a complete pandect of the Jewish
law; More Nevochim, a valuable work, explaining the difficult
passages, phrases, parables, and allegories, in Scripture, and
several other works. This great and learned man died in
Egypt at the age of seventy, and was buried with his nation
in the land of Upper Galilee. His death was mourned for
three whole days by Jews and Egyptians, and the year in
which he died, in respect of his great virtues and learning,
was called Lamentum Lamentabile.

<head>Michael Servetus.</head>

<p>
A native of Villanuova, in Arragon, son of a notary. He
studied the law at Toulouse, but afterwards applied to
medicine at Paris, and took there his doctor's degree. The
boldness and pertinacity of his opinions created him enemies,
and he left the capital to settle at Lyons, but afterwards he
retired to Charlieu. On the invitation of the archbishop of
Vienne, in Dauphiny, he was prevailed upon to fix his residence
there, and he might have lived in peace and respected,
had he been satisfied to seek celebrity in medical pursuits
alone. Eager to publish his Arian opinions on religion, he
sent three questions to Calvin on the Divinity of Christ, on
Regeneration, and on the Necessity of Baptism, and, when
answered with civility, he reflected on the sentiments of his
correspondent with arrogant harshness. This produced a
quarrel, and ended in the most implacable hatred, so that
Calvin, bent on revenge, obtained, by secret means, copies
of a work in which his antagonist was engaged, and caused
him to be accused before the archbishop as a dangerous man.
Servetus escaped from prison; but, on his way to Italy, he
had the imprudence to pass in disguise through Geneva,
where he was recognized by Calvin, and immediately seized
by the magistrate as an impious heretic. Forty heretical
errors were proved against him by his accusers; but Servetus
refused to renounce them, and the magistrates, at last yielding
to the loud representations of the ministers of Bâsle, Berne,
and Zurich, and especially of Calvin, who demanded the
punishment of a profane heretic, ordered the unhappy man
to be burnt. On the 27th October, 1553, the wretched Servetus
was conducted to the stake, and, as the wind prevented
the flames from fully reaching his body, two long hours
elapsed before he was freed from his miseries. This cruel
treatment deservedly called down the general odium on the
head of Calvin, who ably defended his conduct and that of
the magistrates. Servetus published various works against
<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>
the Trinity, which were burnt in disgrace at Geneva, and
other places.

An ecclesiastic of Friesland, embraced the tenets of the

became a powerful leader of his sect. He denied that Jesus
Christ received a human shape from his mother, the virgin
Mary; and while he maintained the necessity of again baptizing
adults, he inveighed against the custom of infant
baptism, which he regarded as Popish innovation. His eloquence
and his learning were so much admired, that he
gained a great number of followers in Westphalia, Guelderland,
Holland, and Brabant; but, though a price was set on
his head, he had the good fortune to escape his persecutors.
He was, in his opinions, more moderate than the rest of the
Anabaptists. His followers are still to be found in the Low
Countries, under the name of <hi rend='italic'>Mennonites</hi>, divided into two

England, and settled at Middleburgh, in Zealand, where they
obtained leave to worship God in their own way, and form a
church according to their own model. They soon, however,
began to differ among themselves, so that Brown, growing
weary of his office, returned to England in 1589, renounced
his principles of separation, and was preferred to the rectory
of a church in Northamptonshire. He died in prison in
1630. The revolt of Brown was attended with the dissolution
of the church at Middleburgh; but the seeds of Brownism
which he had sown in England were so far from being destroyed,
that Sir Walter Raleigh, in a speech in 1592, computes

A native of Oude-water, in Holland, 1560, founder of the

supported at the university of Utrecht, and of Marpurg, by
the liberality of his friends; but when he returned home, in
the midst of the ravages caused by the Spanish arms, instead
of being received by his mother, he found that she, as well
as her daughters, and all her family, had been sacrificed to
the wantonness of the ferocious enemy. His distress was for
a while inconsolable; but the thirst after distinction called
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>
him to the newly-founded university of Leyden, where his
industry acquired him the protection of the magistrates of
Amsterdam, at whose expense he travelled to Geneva and
Italy, to hear the lectures of Theodore Beza and James
Zabarella. On his return to Holland, he was ordained minister
of Amsterdam, 1588. As professor of divinity at Leyden, to
which office he was called 1603, he distinguished himself by
three valuable orations on the object of theology, on the
author and end of it, and on the certainty of it; and he
afterwards explained the prophet Jonah. In his public and
private life, Arminius has been admired for his moderation;
and though many gross insinuations have been thrown against
him, yet his memory has been fully vindicated by the ablest
pens, and he seemed entitled to the motto which he assumed,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>A
good conscience is a paradise.</hi> A life of perpetual labor
and vexation of mind at last brought on a sickness of which
he died, October 19, 1619. His writings were all on controversial

<head>Francis Higginson.</head>

<p>
First minister of Salem, Massachusetts, after receiving his
education at Emanuel College, in Cambridge, became the
minister of a church at Leicester, in England. While his
popular talents filled his church with attentive hearers, such
was the divine blessing upon his labors, that a deep attention
to religious subjects was excited among his people. Becoming
at length a conscientious Nonconformist to the rites of
the English church, some of which he thought not only were
unsupported by Scripture, but corrupted the purity of Christian
worship and discipline, he was excluded from the parish
church, and became obnoxious to the High Commission Court.
One day two messengers came to his house, and with loud
knocks cried out, <q>Where is Mr. Higginson? We must
speak with Mr. Higginson!</q> His wife ran to his chamber,
and entreated him to conceal himself; but he replied, that he
<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>
should acquiesce in the will of God. He went down, and, as
the messengers entered the hall, they presented him with some
papers, saying, in a rough manner, <q>Sir, we came from
London, and our business is to convey you to London, as you
may see by those papers.</q> <q>I thought so,</q> exclaimed Mrs.
Higginson, weeping; but a woman's tears could have but
little effect upon hard-hearted pursuivants. Mr. Higginson
opened the packet to read the form of his arrest, but, instead
of an order from Bishop Laud for his seizure, he found a copy
of the charter of Massachusetts, and letters from the governor
and company, inviting him to embark with them for New
England. The sudden transition of feeling from despondence
to joy, may be better imagined than described.
</p>

<p>
Having sought advice and implored the divine direction,
he resolved to accept the invitation. In his farewell sermon,
preached before a vast assembly, he declared his persuasion,
that England would be chastised by war, and that Leicester
would have more than an ordinary share of sufferings. It
was not long before his prediction was verified. It is not
meant that he claimed the power of foretelling future events,
but he could reason with considerable accuracy from cause
to effect, knowing that iniquity is generally followed by its
punishment; and he lived in an age when it was usual for
ministers to speak with more confidence, and authority, and
efficacy, than at present. He sailed from Gravesend, April
25, 1629, accompanied by Mr. Skelton, whose principles accorded
with his own. When he came to the Land's End, he
called his children and the other passengers on deck to take
the last view of their native country; and he now exclaimed,
<q>Farewell, England! farewell, the church of God in England,
and all the Christian friends there! We do not go to America
as separatists from the church of England, though we
cannot but separate from its corruptions.</q> He then concluded
with a fervent prayer for the king, church, and state,
in England. He arrived at Cape Ann, June 27, 1629, and,
having spent the next day there, which was Sunday, on the
29th he entered the harbor of Salem. July the 20th was
<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>
observed as a day of fasting by the appointment of Governor
Endicott, and the church then made choice of Mr. Higginson
to be their teacher, and Mr. Skelton their pastor.
</p>

<p>
Thus auspicious was the commencement of the settlement
of Naumkeag, or Salem; but the scene was soon changed.
During the first winter, about one hundred persons died, and
Mr. Higginson was soon seized with a hectic, which terminated
his days in August, 1630, aged forty-two. In his last
sickness, he was reminded of his benevolent exertions in the
service of the Lord Jesus Christ. To consoling suggestions
of this kind he replied, <q>I have been an unprofitable servant,
and all my desire is to win Christ, and be found in him, not
having my own righteousness.</q>

<head>Richard Baxter.</head>

<p>
A Nonconformist, born at Rowton, Shropshire, 12th November,
1615. He compensated for the deficiencies of a neglected
education by unusual application, and was appointed master
of Dudley free-school by the interest of Mr. Richard Foley,
of Stourbridge, and soon after admitted into orders by the
bishop of Winchester. His scruples were raised by the oath
which was proposed by the convention at that time sitting,
and he was among the number of those who showed their
dislike to an unqualified submission <q>to archbishops, bishops,
et cetera,</q> as they knew not what the <hi rend='italic'>et cetera</hi> comprehended.
In 1640, he was invited to be minister at Kidderminster; but
the civil war, which broke out soon after, exposed him to
persecution, as he espoused the cause of the parliament. He
retired to Coventry, and continued his ministerial labors till
the success of the republicans recalled him to his favorite
flock at Kidderminster. The usurpation of Cromwell gave
him great offence, and he even presumed to argue in private
with the tyrant on the nature and illegality of his power; but
in the only sermon which he preached before him, he wisely
confined his subject to the dissensions which existed in the
kingdom on religious matters. He was in London after
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>
Cromwell's death, and preached before parliament the day
before the king's return was voted, and likewise before the
lord mayor for Monk's successes. Charles II. made him one
of his chaplains, and Chancellor Clarendon offered him the
bishopric of Hereford, which he declined. He was, however,
soon involved in the general persecution of the Nonconformists.
His paraphrase on the New Testament drew upon
him, in 1685, the vengeance of Jeffreys, and he was condemned
to be imprisoned for two years, from which punishment, six
months after, he was discharged by the interference of Lord
Powis with King James. He died December 8th, 1691, and
was interred in Christ Church.

<p>
The founder of the society of Friends, or Quakers, was born,
in 1624, at Drayton, in Leicestershire, and was the son of a
weaver, a pious and virtuous man, who gave him a religious
education. Being apprenticed to a grazier, he was employed
in keeping sheep&mdash;an occupation, the silence and solitude of
which were well calculated to nurse his naturally enthusiastic
feelings. When he was about nineteen, he believed himself
to have received a divine command to forsake all, renounce
society, and dedicate his existence to the service of religion.
For five years, he accordingly led a wandering life, fasting,
praying, and living secluded; but it was not till about 1648
that he began to preach his doctrines. Manchester was the
place where he first promulgated them. Thenceforth he
pursued his career with untirable zeal and activity, in spite
of frequent imprisonment and brutal usage. It was at Derby
that his followers were first denominated <hi rend='italic'>Quakers</hi>, either from
their tremulous mode of speaking, or from their calling on
their hearers to <q>tremble at the name of the Lord.</q> The
labors of Fox were crowned with considerable success; and,
in 1669, he extended the sphere of them to America, where
he spent two years. He also twice visited the continent.
He died in 1690. His writings were collected in three volumes,
<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>
folio. Whatever may be thought of the tenets of Fox
there can be no doubt that he was sincere in them, and that
he was a man of strict temperance, humility, moderation, and piety.

<head>William Penn.</head>

<p>
The founder of Pennsylvania, born in London, 1644,
From a private school at Chigwell, Essex, he entered, in
1660, as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church, Oxford;
but, as he withdrew from the national forms of worship with
other students, who, like himself, had listened to the preaching
of Thomas Loe, a Quaker of eminence, who was fined for Non-conformity,
and, the next year, as he pertinaciously adhered
to his opinions, he was expelled from the college. His father
sent him to France, and, on his return, he entered at Lincoln's
Inn, as a law student. In 1666, he was sent to manage an
estate in Ireland, and, during his residence there, he renewed
his acquaintance with Loe, and showed such partiality to the
Quakers, that he was, in those days of persecution, taken up
at a meeting at Cork, and imprisoned by the mayor, who at
last restored him to liberty at the request of Lord Orrery.
His return to England produced a violent altercation with
his father, who wished him to abandon those singular habits
so offensive to decorum and established forms; and, when he
refused to appear uncovered before him and before the king,
he a second time dismissed him from his protection and favor.
In 1668, he first appeared as a preacher and as an author
among the Quakers; and, in consequence of some controversial
dispute, he was sent to the Tower, where he remained in
confinement for seven months. The passing of the conventicle
act soon after again sent him to prison in Newgate, from
which he was released by the interest of his father, who about
this time was reconciled to him, and left him, on his decease
some time after, a valuable estate of about fifteen hundred
pounds per annum. In 1672, he married Gulielma Maria
Springett, a lady of principles similar to his own, and then
fixed his residence at Rickmansworth, where he employed
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
himself zealously in promoting the cause of the Friends by
his preaching, as well as by his writings. In 1677, he went,
with George Fox and Robert Barclay, to the continent on a
religious excursion; and, after visiting Amsterdam and the
other chief towns of Holland, they proceeded to the court
of Princess Elizabeth, the granddaughter of James I., at
Herwerden or Herford, where they were received with great
kindness and hospitality. Soon after his return to England,
Charles II. granted him, in consideration of the services of
his father, and for a debt due to him from the crown, a province
of North America, then called New Netherlands, but
now making the state of Pennsylvania. In consequence of
this acquisition, he invited, under the royal patent, settlers
from all parts of the kingdom, and drew up, in twenty-four
articles, the fundamental constitution of his new province, in
which he held out a greater degree of religious liberty than
had at that time appeared in the Christian world. A colony
of people, chiefly of his persuasion, soon flocked to share his
fortunes; the lands of the country were cleared and improved,
and a town was built, which, on the principle of brotherly
love, received the name of <hi rend='italic'>Philadelphia</hi>. In 1682, Penn
visited the province, and confirmed that good understanding
which he had recommended with the natives; and, after two
years' residence, and with the satisfaction of witnessing and
promoting the prosperity of the colonists, he returned to
England. Soon after, Charles died, and the acquaintance
which Penn had with the new monarch was honorably used
to protect the people of his persuasion. At the revolution
however, he was suspected of treasonable correspondence
with the exiled prince, and therefore exposed to molestation
and persecution. In 1694, he lost his wife; but, though
severely afflicted by the event, he in about two years married
again, and afterwards employed himself in travelling in Ireland,
and over England, in disseminating, as a preacher, the
doctrines of his sect. He visited, in 1699, his province with
his wife and family, and returned to England in 1701. The
suspicion with which he had been regarded under William's
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>
government, ceased at the accession of Queen Anne, and the
unyielding advocate of Quakerism was permitted to live with
greater freedom, and to fear persecution less. In 1710, he
removed to Rushcomb, near Twyford, Berks, where he spent
the rest of his life. Three repeated attacks of an apoplexy
at last came to weaken his faculties and his constitution, and,
after nearly losing all recollection of his former friends and
associates, he expired, 30th July, 1718, and was buried at
Jordan, near Beaconsfield, Bucks. The character of Penn
is truly amiable, benevolent, and humane; his labors were
exerted for the good of mankind, and, with the strictest consistency
of moral conduct and religious opinion, he endured
persecution and malice with resignation; and, guided by the
approbation of a pure conscience, he showed himself indefatigable
in the fulfilling of what he considered as the law of
God, and the clear demonstration of the truth of the gospel.
The long prosperity of Pennsylvania, and of his favorite city,
Philadelphia, furnishes the best evidence of his wisdom as a
legislator.

<head>Benedict Spinoza.</head>

<p>
An atheistical writer, son of a Portuguese Jew, born at
Amsterdam, 1638. He studied medicine and theology; but
his religion was so loose, and his inquiries for the reason of
every thing which he was to believe, became so offensive to
the rabbies, that he was thrust out of the synagogue. In
consequence of this, he became a Christian, and was baptized;
but his conversion was insincere, and though, during
his life, he did not openly profess himself an atheist, his
posthumous works plainly proved him such. He died, of a
consumption, at the Hague, February, 1677, aged forty-five.
He is the founder of a regular system of atheism, and by his
hypothesis he wished to establish that there is but one substance
in nature, which is endowed with infinite attributes,
with extension and thought; that all spirits are modifications
of that substance; and that God, the necessary and most
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
perfect being, is the cause of all things that exist, but does
not differ from them. These monstrous doctrines, though
not new, were thus built into a regular system by this extraordinary
man, who is said in other respects to have been of
a good moral character in private life, benevolent, friendly,
and charitable. His conduct was marked by no licentiousness
or irregularity; but he retired from the tumults of Amsterdam
to a more peaceful residence at the Hague, where curiosity
led princes, philosophers, and learned men, to see and to
converse with this bold assertor of atheism.

<head>Ann Lee.</head>

<p>
Born in the town of Manchester, in England, in 1736.
Her father, John Lee, though not in affluent circumstances,
was an honest and industrious man. Her mother was esteemed
as a very pious woman. As was common with the
laboring classes of people in England at that period, their
children, instead of being sent to school, were brought up to
work from early childhood. By this means, Ann, though
quite illiterate, acquired a habit of industry, and was early
distinguished for her activity, faithfulness, neatness, and good
economy in her temporal employments.
</p>

<p>
From early childhood she was the subject of religious
impressions and divine manifestations. These continued, in
a greater or less degree, as she advanced in years; so that, at
times, she was strongly impressed with a sense of the great
depravity of human nature, and of the lost state of mankind
by reason of sin. But losing her mother at an early age,
and finding no person to assist her in the pursuit of a life of
holiness, and being urged by the solicitations of her relations
and friends, she was married to Abraham Stanley, by whom
she had four children, who all died in infancy. But the
convictions of her youth often returned upon her with great
force, which at length brought her under excessive tribulation
of soul. In this situation, she sought earnestly for deliverance
from the bondage of sin.
</p>

<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>

<p>
While under these exercises of mind, she became acquainted
with a society of people associated under the ministration of
James Wardly, who, with Jane, his wife, had been greatly
favored with divine manifestations concerning the second
appearing of Christ, which they foresaw was near at hand.
Ann readily embraced their testimony, and united herself to
the society in the month of September, 1758.
</p>

<p>
In this society, Ann found that strength and protection
against the powerful influences of evil, which, for the time
being, were answerable to her faith; and, by her faithful
obedience, she by degrees attained to the full knowledge and
experience in spiritual things which they had found. But as
she still found in herself the remains of the propensities of
fallen nature, she could not rest satisfied short of full salvation;
she therefore sought earnestly, day and night, in the
most fervent prayers and cries to God, to find complete
deliverance from a sinful nature, and to know more perfectly
the way of full redemption and final salvation.
</p>

<p>
After passing through many scenes of tribulation and
suffering, she received a full answer to her prayers and
desires to God. She then came forward, and, with extraordinary
power and energy of spirit, testified that she had
received, through the Spirit of Christ, a full revelation of the
fallen nature of man, and of the only means of redemption,
which were comprised in his precepts and living example
while on earth. The astonishing power of God which accompanied
her testimony of this revelation to the society,
was too awakening and convincing to leave a doubt on the
minds of the society of its divine authority. When, therefore,
Ann had thus manifested to the society the revelation of light
which she had received, she was received and acknowledged
as their leader and spiritual <hi rend='italic'>Mother in Christ</hi>. This was the
only name of distinction by which she was known in the
society. The term <hi rend='italic'>Elect Lady</hi> was given to her by her
enemies. Ann, with a number of her followers, visited
America in 1774, and formed the first society of Shakers in
this country, at Watervliet, N. Y., where she died in 1784.

In 1689, he taught a school in Philadelphia. After
various exertions, writing and travelling for the propagation
of the sentiments of his sect, he at first seceded, and at length
entirely deserted the society. In England, he became an
Episcopalian, and was consecrated as an Episcopal missionary,
and in that capacity officiated for a short time in New York
and Boston. Returning to England in 1706, he was a rector
at Edburton, in Sussex, where he died. His publications

<head>Nicholas Louis, Count Zinzendorf.</head>

<p>
The patron of the sect of the Moravians, was born at Dresden,
in May, 1700. He studied at Halle and Utrecht. About
the year 1721, he purchased the lordship of Bertholdsdorf, in
Lusatia. Some poor Christians, the followers of John Huss,
obtained leave, in 1722, to settle on his estate. They soon
made converts. Such was the origin of the village of Herrnhut.
Their noble patron soon after joined them.
</p>

<p>
From this period Count Zinzendorf devoted himself to the
business of instructing his fellow-men by his writings and by
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>
preaching. He travelled through Germany, and in Denmark
became acquainted with the Danish missions in the East Indies
and Greenland. About 1732, he engaged earnestly in
the promotion of missions by his Moravian brethren, whose
numbers at Herrnhut were then about five hundred. So successful
were these missions, that in a few years four thousand
negroes were baptized in the West Indies, and the converts
in Greenland amounted to seven hundred and eighty-four.
</p>

<p>
In 1737, he visited London, and, in 1741, came to America,
and preached at Germantown and Bethlehem. February 11,
1742, he ordained at Oly, in Pennsylvania, the missionaries
Rauch and Buettner, and Rauch baptized three Indians
from Shekomeco, east of the Hudson, <q>the firstlings of the
Indians.</q> He soon, with his daughter, Benigna, and several
brethren and sisters, visited various tribes of Indians. At
Shekomeco he established the first Indian Moravian congregation
in North America. In 1743, he returned to Europe.
He died at Herrnhut, in 1760, and his coffin was carried to
the grave by thirty-two preachers and missionaries, whom he
had reared, and some of whom had toiled in Holland, England,
Ireland, North America, and Greenland. What monarch was
ever honored by a funeral like this?

Archbishop of Canterbury, the fourth son of Hugh

possessed of abilities, owed his elevation in the church to
the consequence of his family. When twenty-eight, he was
made bishop of Hereford, and afterwards translated to London,
where he summoned before him the great Wickliffe, in St.
Paul's Cathedral, 1377. The bold reformer was on this
occasion attended by his friends John of Gaunt and Lord
Percy, who, in supporting his tenets, treated the prelate with
such asperity, that a tumult was excited among the citizens
<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>
of London. Courtney was made chancellor, 1381, and afterwards
raised to the see of Canterbury. He was a violent
persecutor of the Wickliffites, and condemned their tenets in
a synod. He died at Maidstone, 1396, aged 55.

Oxford, where he was distinguished for his piety and exemplary
conduct. An unhappy marriage, which he contracted
before he was thirty, with a scold who had neither beauty,
money, nor manners, lost him his college fellowship, and was
a fertile source of annoyance to him. In 1585, he was made
master of the Temple; but, weary of disputes with the afternoon
lecturer,&mdash;a violent Presbyterian,&mdash;and longing for
rural retirement, he relinquished this preferment, and obtained
the rectory of Bishop's Bourne, in Kent, at which he
resided till his decease, in 1600. His great work is the treatise

<head>Roger Williams.</head>

<p>
The founder of the Providence Plantations, born in Wales,
in 1599, and was educated at Oxford. Being a dissenter,
he came to America, in the hope of enjoying in freedom his
religious opinions. He arrived at Hull, February 5, 1631,
and was established at Salem, Massachusetts, as colleague
with Mr. Skelton. His peculiar notions soon subjected him
to the severest censure. He maintained that the magistrates
were bound to grant toleration to all sects of Christians, and
in his actions and words avowed the liberality of his principles.
After the death of Mr. Skelton, he was sole minister
of Salem. Continuing to avow his opinions, which were
considered not only heretical, but seditious, he was summoned
before the General Court, to answer to numerous charges.
He, however, refused to retract any of his opinions, and was
accordingly banished, 1635. He first repaired to Seekonk:
but, being informed that that territory was within the jurisdiction
of Plymouth, he proceeded to Mooshausic, where,
with others, in 1636, he began a plantation. The land
was honestly purchased of the Indians; and the town, in
acknowledgment of the kindness of Heaven, was called Providence.
Mr. Williams's benevolence was not confined to his
civilized brethren; he learned the language of the Indians,
travelled among them, won the entire confidence of their
chiefs, and was often the means of saving from injury the
colony that had driven him from its protection. In 1643, he
was sent to England, as agent for both settlements, and in
September, 1644, returned with a patent for the territory,
with permission for the inhabitants to institute a government
for themselves. In 1651, he was again sent to England, in
the capacity of agent, and returned in 1654, when he was
chosen president of the government. Benedict Arnold succeeded
him in 1657. He died in April, 1683, aged eighty-four.
Mr. Williams was consistent in his religious doctrines,
and set a bright example of that toleration which he demanded
from others. His mind was strong and well cultivated; and
<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>
he read the Scriptures in the originals. After his banishment
from Massachusetts, he maintained a correspondence with
some of its principal men, and ever entertained for them the
highest affection and respect. In his writings, he evinces
his power at argument. In 1672, he held a public dispute
with the most eminent Quaker preachers, of which he has
published an account. He also published a <q>Key to the Indian
Language,</q> octavo, 1643; an answer to Mr. Cotton's letters,
concerning the power of the magistrate in matters of religion,
with other letters and discourses.

<head>John Clarke.</head>

<p>
A distinguished Baptist minister, and one of the first founders
of Rhode Island, was a physician in London, before he came
to this country. Soon after the first settlement of Massachusetts,
he was driven from that colony with a number of
others; and March 7, 1638, they formed themselves into
a body politic, and purchased Aquetneck of the Indian
sachems, calling it the Isle of Rhodes, or Rhode Island.
The settlement commenced at Pocasset, or Portsmouth.
The Indian deed is dated March 24, 1638. Mr. Clarke was
soon employed as a preacher; and, in 1644, he formed a
church at Newport, and became its pastor. This was the
second Baptist church which was established in America.
</p>

<p>
In 1649, he was an assistant and treasurer of Rhode
Island colony. In 1651, he went to visit one of his brethren
at Lynn, near Boston, and he preached on Sunday, July 20;
but, before he had completed the services of the forenoon, he
was seized, with his friends, by an officer of the government.
In the afternoon, he was compelled to attend the parish meeting,
at the close of which he spoke a few words. He was
tried before the Court of Assistants, and fined twenty pounds;
in case of failure in the payment of which sum he was to be
whipped. In passing the sentence, Judge Endicott observed,
<q>You secretly insinuate things into those who are weak,
which you cannot maintain before our ministers; you may
<pb n='388'/><anchor id='Pg388'/>
try and dispute with them.</q> Mr. Clarke accordingly wrote
from prison, proposing a dispute upon the principles which
he professed. He represented his principles to be, that Jesus
Christ had the sole right of prescribing any laws respecting
the worship of God which it was necessary to obey; that
baptism, or dipping in water, was an ordinance to be administered
only to those who gave some evidence of repentance
towards God and faith in Jesus Christ; that such visible believers
only constituted the church; that each of them had a
right to speak in the congregation, according as the Lord
had given him talents, either to make inquiries for his own
instruction, or to prophesy for the edification of others, and
that at all times and in all places they ought to reprove folly
and open their lips to justify wisdom; and that no servant of
Jesus Christ had any authority to restrain any fellow-servant
in his worship, where injury was not offered to others. No
dispute, however, occurred, and Mr. Clarke, his friends paying
his fine without his consent, was soon released from
prison, and directed to leave the colony. His companion
Obadiah Holmes shared a severer fate; for, on declining to
pay his fine of thirty pounds, which his friends offered to do
for him, he was publicly whipped in Boston.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Clarke died at Newport, April 20, 1676, aged about
66 years, resigning his soul to his merciful Redeemer, through
faith in whose name he enjoyed the hope of a resurrection to
eternal life.
</p>

<p>
His life was so pure, that he was never accused of any
vice, to leave a blot on his memory. His noble sentiments
respecting religious toleration did not, indeed, accord with the
sentiments of the age in which he lived, and exposed him to
trouble; but at the present time they are almost universally
embraced. His exertions to promote the civil prosperity of
Rhode Island must endear his name to those who are now
enjoying the fruits of his labors. He possessed the singular
honor of contributing much towards establishing the first
government upon the earth, which gave equal liberty, civil
and religious, to all men living under it.

<head>Ann Hutchinson.</head>

<p>
A woman who occasioned much difficulty in New England,
soon after its first settlement, came from Lincolnshire to
Boston, 1635, and was the wife of one of the representatives
of Boston. The members of Mr. Cotton's church used to
meet every week to repeat his sermons, and discourse on
doctrines. She set up meetings for women, and soon had a
numerous audience. After repeating the sermons of Mr.
Cotton, she added reflections of her own; she advocated her
own sentiments, and warped the discourses of her minister to
coincide with them. She soon threw the whole colony into
a flame. The progress of her sentiments occasioned the
synod of 1637, the first synod in America. This convention
of ministers condemned eighty-two erroneous opinions, then
propagated in the country. Mrs. Hutchinson, after this sentence
of her opinions, was herself called before the court in
November of the same year, and, being convicted of traducing
the ministers, and advancing errors, was banished the colony.
She went with her husband to Rhode Island. In the year
1642, after her husband's death, she removed into the Dutch
country beyond New Haven; and the next year, she, her son
Francis, and most of her family of sixteen persons, were
killed by the Indians.

Rome, where, in 1675, he published his <q>Spiritual Guide,</q>
which gave him universal reputation. The Jesuits and Dominicans,
envious at his success, charged him with heresy, and
at last succeeded in getting him condemned by the Inquisition.

<head>John Wesley.</head>

<p>
The great founder of Methodism was born at Epworth, in
England, in 1703. In 1714, he was placed at the Charter
House; and two years after he was elected to Christ Church,
Oxford. In 1725, he was ordained deacon, and the next year
became fellow and tutor of Lincoln College.
</p>

<p>
Wesley's character, says his biographer, is itself a study.
He equalled Luther in energy and courage, and Melancthon
in learning and prudence. All the excellences of both the
Wittemberg reformers were combined, if not transcended, in
his individual character.
</p>

<p>
He possessed, in an eminent degree, the power of comprehending
at once the general outlines and the details of plans,
the aggregate and the integrants. It is this power which
forms the philosophical genius in science; it is indispensable
to the successful commander and the great statesman. It is
illustrated in the whole economical system of Methodism&mdash;a
system which, while it fixes itself to the smallest localities
with the utmost detail and tenacity, is sufficiently general in
its provisions to reach the ends of the world, and still maintain
its unity of spirit and discipline.
</p>

<p>
No man knew better than Wesley the importance of
small things. His whole financial system was based on
weekly penny collections. It was a rule of his preachers
never to omit a single preaching appointment, except when
the <q>risk of limb or life</q> required. He was the first to
apply extensively the plan of tract distribution. He wrote,
printed, and scattered over the kingdom, placards on almost
every topic of morals and religion. In addition to the usual
means of grace, he introduced the band meeting, the class
meeting, the prayer meeting, the love feast, and the watch
night. Not content with his itinerant laborers, he called into
use the less available powers of his people by establishing
the new departments of local preachers, exhorters, and leaders.
It was, in fine, by gathering together fragments, by combining
<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>
minutiæ, that he formed that stupendous system of spiritual
means which is rapidly evangelizing the world.
</p>

<p>
It was not only in the theoretical construction of plans
that he excelled; he was, if possible, still more distinguished
by practical energy. The variety and number of his labors
would be absolutely incredible with less authentic evidence
than that which corroborates them. He was perpetually
travelling and preaching, studying and writing, translating
and abridging, superintending his societies, and applying his
great plans. He travelled usually <emph>five thousand</emph> miles a year,
preaching twice and thrice a day, commencing at five o'clock
in the morning. In the midst of all this travelling and
preaching, he carried with him the meditative and studious
habits of the philosopher. No department of human inquiry
was omitted by him. <q>History, poetry, and philosophy,</q>
said he, <q>I read on horseback.</q>
</p>

<p>
Like Luther, he knew the importance of the press; he
kept it teeming with his publications. His itinerant preachers
were good agents for their circulation. <q>Carry them with
you through every round,</q> he would say; <q>exert yourselves in
this; be not ashamed, be not weary, leave no stone unturned.</q>
His works, including abridgments and translations, amounted
to about two hundred volumes. These comprise treatises on
almost every subject of divinity, poetry, music, history,&mdash;natural,
moral, metaphysical, and political philosophy. He
wrote, as he preached,
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad populum</foreign>; and his works have given
to his people, especially in Great Britain, an elevated tone of
intelligence as well as of piety. He may, indeed, be considered
the leader in those exertions which are now being made
for the popular diffusion of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Differing from the usual character of men who are given
to various exertions and many plans, he was accurate and
profound. He was an adept in classical literature and the
use of the classical tongues; his writings are adorned with
their finest passages. He was familiar with a number of
modern languages; his own style is one of the best examples
of strength and perspicuity among English writers. He was
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
ready on every subject of learning and general literature.
As a logician, he was considered by his enemies, as well as
his friends, to be unrivalled.
</p>

<p>
He was but little addicted to those exhilarations and contrarieties
of frame which characterize imaginative minds.
His temperament was warm, but not fiery. His intellect
never appears inflamed, but was a glowing, serene radiance.
His immense labors were accomplished, not by the impulses
of restless enthusiasm, but by the cool calculations of his
plans, and the steady self-possession with which he pursued
them. <q>Though always in haste,</q> he said, <q>I am never in a
hurry.</q> He was as economical with his time as a miser could
be with his gold; rising at four o'clock in the morning, and
allotting to every hour its appropriate work. <q>Leisure and
I have taken leave of each other,</q> said he. And yet such
was the happy arrangement of his employments, that, amidst
a multiplicity that would distract an ordinary man, he declares
that <q>there are few persons who spend so many hours
secluded from all company as myself.</q> <q>The wonder of his
character,</q> said Robert Hall, <q>is the self-control by which
he preserved himself calm, while he kept all in excitement
around him. He was the last man to be infected by fanaticism.
His writings abound in statements of preternatural
circumstances; but it must be remembered that his faults in
these respects were those of his age, while his virtues were
peculiarly his own.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though of a feeble constitution, the regularity of his
habits, sustained through a life of great exertions and vicissitudes,
produced a vigor and equanimity which are seldom
the accompaniments of a laborious mind or of a distracted
life. <q>I do not remember,</q> he says, <q>to have felt lowness
of spirits one quarter of an hour since I was born.</q> <q>Ten
thousand cares are no more weight to my mind than ten
thousand hairs are to my head.</q> <q>I have never lost a night's
sleep in my life.</q> <q>His face was remarkably fine, his complexion
fresh to the last week of his life, and his eye quick,
keen, and active.</q> He ceased not his labors till death. After
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>
the eightieth year of his age, he visited Holland twice. At
the end of his eighty-second, he says, <q>I am never tired (such
is the goodness of God) either with writing, preaching, or
travelling.</q> He preached under trees which he had planted
himself, at Kingswood. He outlived most of his first disciples
and preachers, and stood up, mighty in intellect and labors,
among the second and third generations of his people. In
his later years persecution had subsided; he was every where
received as a patriarch, and sometimes excited, by his arrival
in towns and cities, an interest <q>such as the presence of
the king himself would produce.</q> He attracted the largest
assemblies, perhaps, which were ever congregated for religious
instruction, being estimated sometimes at more than <emph>thirty
thousand</emph>! Great intellectually, morally, and physically, he
at length died, in the eighty-eighth year of his age and
sixty-fifth of his ministry, unquestionably one of the most
extraordinary men of any age.
</p>

<p>
Nearly one hundred and forty thousand members, upward
of five hundred itinerant, and more than one thousand local
preachers, were connected with him when he died.

<head>George Whitefield.</head>

<p>
One of the founders of the sect of the Methodists, born
at Gloucester, where his mother kept the Bell inn, 1714.
From the Crypt school of his native town, he entered as
servitor at Pembroke College, Oxford, and was ordained at
the proper age by Benson, bishop of Gloucester. Enthusiasm
and the love of singularity now influenced his conduct, and
in his eagerness to obtain popularity, he preached not only
in prisons, but in the open fields, and by a strong persuasive
eloquence, multitudes regarded him as a man of superior
sanctity. In 1738, he went to America, to increase the
number of his converts; but, after laboring for some time as
the friend and the associate of the Wesleys, he at last was
engaged with them in a serious dispute, which produced a
separation. While he zealously asserted the doctrine of
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>
absolute election and final perseverance, agreeably to the
notions of Calvin, his opponents regarded his opinion as
unsupported by Scripture, and therefore inadmissible; and in
consequence of this arose the two sects of the Calvinistic and
the Arminian Methodists. Secure in the good opinion of a
great number of adherents, and in the patronage of Lady
Huntingdon, to whom he was chaplain, he continued his labors,
and built two Tabernacles in the city and in Tottenham
Court Road for the commodious reception of his followers.
He died at Newburyport, Massachusetts, while on a visit to
his churches in America, and had the satisfaction to know
that his adherents were numerous on both continents.

Gloucester, England, December 16, 1714; educated at
Oxford University; ordained 1736. In a ministry of thirty-four
years, he crossed the Atlantic thirteen times, and
preached more than eighteen thousand sermons. As a soldier
of the cross, humble, devoted, ardent, he put on the
whole armor of God; preferring the honor of Christ to his
own interest, repose, reputation, and life. As a Christian
orator, his deep piety, disinterested zeal, and vivid imagination,
gave unexampled energy to his look, utterance, and
action. Bold, fervent, pungent, and popular in his eloquence,
no other uninspired man ever preached to so large assemblies,
or enforced the simple truths of the gospel by motives so
persuasive and awful, and with an influence so powerful on
the hearts of his hearers. He died of asthma, September 30,
1770, suddenly exchanging his life of unparalleled labors for
his eternal rest.</q>

<p>
During Mr. Whitefield's visit to Philadelphia, he preached
often in the evening from the gallery of the court-house in
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>
Market Street. So loud was his voice at that time, that it
was distinctly heard on the Jersey shore, and so distinct
was his speech, that every word he said was understood at
Market Street wharf, a distance of upwards of four hundred
feet from the court-house. All the intermediate space was
crowded with his hearers. Mr. Whitefield was truly remarkable
for his uncommon eloquence and fervent zeal. His
eloquence was indeed very great, and of the truest kind. He
was utterly devoid of all affectation; the importance of his
subject, and the regard due to his hearers, engrossed all his
concern. Every accent of his voice spoke to the ear, every
feature of his face, every motion of his hands, and every
gesture, spoke to the eye; so that the most dissipated and
thoughtless found their attention arrested, and the dullest
and most ignorant could not but understand. He appeared
to be devoid of the spirit of sectarianism; his only object
seemed to be to <q>preach Christ and him crucified.</q>
</p>

<p>
The following anecdote respecting his manner of preaching
will serve to illustrate this part of his character. One day,
while preaching from the balcony of the court-house, in
Philadelphia, he cried out, <q>Father Abraham, who have you
got in heaven; any <hi rend='italic'>Episcopalians</hi>?</q>
<q>No!</q> <q>Any <hi rend='italic'>Presbyterians</hi>?</q>
<q>No!</q> <q>Any <hi rend='italic'>Baptists</hi>?</q> <q>No!</q> <q>Have you

<q>No!</q> <q>Have you any <hi rend='italic'>Independents</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>Seceders</hi>?</q> <q>No! No!</q> <q>Why, who have you, then?</q>
<q>We don't know those names here; all that are here are
<hi rend='italic'>Christians</hi>&mdash;believers in Christ&mdash;men who have overcome
by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of his testimony!</q>
<q>O, is this the case? then God help me&mdash;God help us all&mdash;to
forget party names, and to become Christians in deed
and in truth.</q>

<p>
Countess, second daughter of Washington, earl Ferrers,
born 1707, and married Lord Huntingdon, by whom she
had four sons and three daughters. From habits of gayety
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>
and scenes of dissipation, she became all at once, after a serious
illness, grave, reserved, and melancholy. Her thoughts
were wholly absorbed by religion, and she employed the ample
resources which she possessed in disseminating her principles
by the popular arts of Whitefield, Romaine, and others. Not
only her house in Park Street was thrown open for the frequent
assembling of these pious reformers, but chapels were built
in various parts of the kingdom, and a college erected in
Wales for the education of young persons in the future labors
of the ministry. After many acts of extensive charity,
and with the best intentions, this enthusiastic lady died

turned preacher. He came to America in October,
1764, and from Boston he went to Danbury, Connecticut.
In that town he gathered a church the following year. He
afterwards established several societies in New England.
Individuals are still found who adhere to his peculiarities,

<head>Samuel Hopkins.</head>

<p>
An American divine, who, in his sermons and tracts, has
made several additions to the sentiments first advanced by
the celebrated Jonathan Edwards, late president of New
Jersey College. Dr. Hopkins was born at Waterbury, in
Connecticut, 1721, and graduated at Yale College, in 1741.
Soon after, he engaged in theological studies, at Northampton,
Massachusetts, under the superintendence of Jonathan
Edwards, and, in 1743, was ordained at Housatonic, now
Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where he continued till he
removed to Newport, Rhode Island, in consequence of the
diminution of his congregation, and his want of support.
When he had resided some time in this place, the people
became dissatisfied with his sentiments, and resolved, at a
meeting, to intimate to him their disinclination to his continuance
among them. On the ensuing Sabbath, he preached
his farewell discourse, which was so interesting and impressive
that they besought him to remain, which he did till his
death, in 1803. He was a pious and zealous man, of considerable
talents, and almost incredible powers of application.
He is said to have been sometimes engaged during eighteen
hours in his studies. His doctrinal views are contained in
his <q>System of Divinity,</q> published in a second edition at
Boston, in 1811, in two volumes, octavo.

<head>Samuel Seabury.</head>

<p>
First bishop of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United
States, was born in 1728, and graduated at Yale College in
1751. After finishing his classical education, he went to
Scotland with the view of studying medicine; but soon, having
turned his attention to theology, he altered his purpose and
took orders in London, 1753. Returning to America, he
officiated, first at Brunswick, New Jersey, then at Jamaica,
Long Island, next at West Chester, New York, and lastly at
New London, Connecticut, where he remained, as rector
of the parish in that city, during the remainder of his life.
As much as he was esteemed by his parishioners, his influence
was extended among his brethren throughout the state.
Consequently, when the Episcopal church was organized in
that diocese, he was elected bishop. He went immediately
to England, in order to obtain consecration; but, meeting
with some unexpected obstacles, he repaired to Scotland.
Here he was able to accomplish the object of his mission.
He was consecrated at Aberdeen, November 14, 1784. As
soon as he was able to reach home, he resumed his duties
as parish minister at New London, in connection with his
episcopal functions for the diocese. Bishop Seabury had a
vigorous and well-cultivated mind, and acquired a reputation
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>
corresponding with his high station. Three volumes of his
sermons have been published.

</p>

<p>
<q>Ingenious without pride, learned without pedantry, good

of the Christian and the Bishop. In the pulpit he enforced
religion; in his conduct he exemplified it. The poor he
assisted with his charity; the ignorant he blessed with his
instruction. The friend of men, he ever designed their good;
the enemy of vice, he ever opposed it. Christian, dost thou

Here he was greatly admired as a popular preacher, and
highly respected as an exemplary, amiable, benevolent, and
liberal man. He returned to England in 1759, and was soon
afterwards appointed a stated preacher in one of the principal
churches in London. In this station, his eloquence and piety

<head>Joseph Priestly.</head>

<p>
An English philosopher and dissenting divine, born at Fieldheald,
Yorkshire, 1733. He was educated at Daventry, under
Dr. Ashworth, for the ministry among the dissenters, and at
the proper age he took care of a congregation at Needham
Market, Suffolk, and afterwards at Nantwich, Cheshire. He
became, in 1761, professor of belles lettres in the Warrington
Academy, and after seven years' residence there he removed
to Leeds, and two years after accepted the office of librarian
and philosophical companion to the earl of Shelburne. In
this retreat, the philosopher devoted himself laboriously to
metaphysical and theological studies, and published various
works; and when, at last, he separated from his noble patron,
he retired with an annual pension of one hundred and fifty
pounds, to settle at Birmingham, as pastor to a Unitarian
congregation, in 1780. While here usefully employed in
advancing the cause of philosophy, and too often engaged in
theological disputes, he became the victim of popular fury;
and the conduct of some of his neighbors in celebrating the
anniversary of the French revolution, in 1791, with more
intemperance than became Englishmen and loyal subjects,
excited a dreadful riot. Not only the meeting-houses were
destroyed on this melancholy occasion, but, among others, Dr.
Priestley's house, library, manuscripts, and philosophical apparatus,
were totally consumed; and, though he recovered a
compensation by suing the county, he quitted this scene of
prejudice and unpopularity. After residing some time at
London and Hackney, where he preached to the congregation
over which his friend Price once presided, he determined
to quit his native country, and seek a more peaceful retreat
in America, where some of his family were already settled.
He left England in 1794, and fixed his residence at Northumberland,
in Pennsylvania, where he died in 1804. His
writings were very numerous, and he long attracted the
public notice, not only by discoveries in philosophy, but by
the boldness of his theological opinions. Had he confined
<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>
his studies merely to philosophical pursuits, his name would
have descended to posterity with greater lustre; but he who
attempts innovations in government and religion, for singularity,
and to excite popular prejudices, must be little entitled
to the applauses of the world.

<p>
A learned Arian preacher, born at a little village of Berwickshire,
in 1734. His father was only a keeper of cattle, and
intended James for the same profession. He, meanwhile,
having obtained the loan of some books on mathematics,
made himself master of geometry and trigonometry, and
afterwards taught these sciences, with other branches of
mathematics, and assisted some public authors in compiling
mathematical works, which have been well received. He
joined a party of the ancient Cameronians, and in 1769, at
one of their general meetings, was called to be a pastor
among them. To qualify himself for this office, he studied
the Greek and Hebrew languages, and compiled a Hebrew
grammar, which is still in manuscript. These acquisitions
led him into the study of the Arian controversy, when finally
he adopted the opinions of Arius, and afterwards became
preacher to a small Arian congregation in Edinburgh, where
he also kept a school and a book-shop, for many years before

<head>John Tillotson.</head>

<p>
An eminent prelate, was born in 1630, at Sowerby, in Yorkshire,
and was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge. In 1691,
after fruitless attempts to avoid the honor, he accepted, with
unfeigned reluctance, the see of Canterbury, which was
become vacant by the deprivation of Sancroft. This promotion,
however, he did not long survive, as his decease took
place in 1694.
</p>

<p>
In his domestic relations, friendships, and the whole
commerce of business, he was easy and humble, frank
and open, tender-hearted and bountiful, to such an extent,
that, while he was in a private station, he laid aside two
tenths of his income for charitable uses. He despised wealth
but as it furnished him for charity, in which he was judicious
as well as liberal. His affability and candor, as well as
abilities in his profession, made him frequently consulted in
points relating both to practice and opinion. His love for
the real philosophy of nature, and his conviction that the
study of it is the most solid support of religion, induced him,
not many years after the establishment of the Royal Society,
to desire to be admitted into that assembly of the greatest
men of the age; into which he was accordingly elected on
<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>
the 25th of January, 1672. His kindness towards the dissenters
was attended with the consequence intended by him,
of reconciling many of them to the communion of the established
church, and almost all of them to a greater esteem of
it than they had before entertained.
</p>

He died poor, the copy-right of his Posthumous Sermons
(which, however, sold for two thousand five hundred guineas)
being all that his family inherited. His works form three

<head>Isaac Newton.</head>

<p>
A most celebrated English philosopher and mathematician,
and one of the greatest geniuses that ever appeared in the
world, descended from an ancient family in Lincolnshire,
where he was born in the year 1642. His powers of mind
were wonderfully comprehensive and penetrating. Fontenelle
says of him, <q>that in learning mathematics, he did not
study Euclid, who seemed to him too plain and simple, and
unworthy of taking up his time. He understood him almost
before he read him: a cast of his eye on the contents of the
theorems of that great mathematician, seemed to be sufficient
to make him master of them.</q> Several of his works mark a
profundity of thought and reflection that has astonished the
most learned men. He was highly esteemed by the university
of Cambridge, and was twice chosen to represent that
place in parliament. He was also greatly favored by Queen
Anne, and by George I. The princess of Wales, afterwards
queen consort of England, who had a turn for
philosophical inquiries, used frequently to propose questions
to him. This princess had a great regard for him, and often
declared that she thought herself happy to live at the same
time as he did, and to have the pleasure and advantage of his
conversation.
</p>

<p>
This eminent philosopher was remarkable for being of a
very meek disposition and a great lover of peace. He would
rather have chosen to remain in obscurity, than to have the
<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>
serenity of his days disturbed by those storms and disputes,
which genius and learning often draw upon those who are
eminent for them. We find him reflecting on the controversy
respecting his optic lectures (in which he had been almost
unavoidably engaged) in the following terms:&mdash;<q>I blamed
my own imprudence, for parting with so real a blessing as my
quiet, to run after a shadow.</q>
</p>

<p>
The amiable quality of modesty stands very conspicuous
in the character of this great man's mind and manners. He
never spoke, either of himself or others, in such a manner as
to give the most malicious censurers the least occasion even
to suspect him of vanity. He was candid and affable; and
he did not assume any airs of superiority over those with
whom he associated. He never thought either his merit or
his reputation sufficient to excuse him from any of the common
offices of social life. Though he was firmly attached to
the church of England, he was averse to the persecution of
the Nonconformists. He judged of men by their conduct;
and the true schismatics, in his opinion, were the vicious and
the wicked. This liberality of sentiment did not spring from
the want of religion; for he was thoroughly persuaded of the
truth of revelation; and amidst the great variety of books
which he had constantly before him, that which he loved the
best, and studied with the greatest application, was the Bible.
He was, indeed, a truly pious man; and his discoveries concerning
the frame and system of the universe, were applied
by him to demonstrate the being of a God, and to illustrate
his power and wisdom. He also wrote an excellent discourse,
to prove that the remarkable prophecy of Daniel's
weeks was an express prediction of the coming of the Messiah,
and that it was fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of the pious and learned Dr. Doddridge to
the most interesting part of this great man's character, cannot
be omitted on the present occasion. <q>According to the
best information,</q> says he, <q>whether public or private, I
could ever obtain, his firm faith in the divine revelation discovered
itself in the most genuine fruits of substantial virtue
<pb n='405'/><anchor id='Pg405'/>
and piety, and consequently gives us the justest reason to
conclude that he is now rejoicing in the happy effects of it,
infinitely more than in all the applause which his philosophical
works have procured him, though they have commanded
a fame lasting as the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
He departed this life in the eighty-fifth year of his age,
and, in his principles and conduct through life, has left a
strong and comfortable evidence that the highest intellectual
powers harmonize with religion and virtue, and that there is
nothing in Christianity but what will abide the scrutiny of the
soundest and most enlarged understanding.
</p>

<p>
How great and satisfactory a confirmation is it to the sincere,
humble Christian, and what an insurmountable barrier
does it present to the infidel, to perceive, in the list of Christian
believers, the exalted and venerable name of Newton!
a man who must be acknowledged to be an ornament of
human nature, when we consider the wide compass of his
abilities, the great extent of his learning and knowledge, and
the piety, integrity, and beneficence, of his life. This eminent
character firmly adhered to the belief of Christianity,
after the most diligent and exact researches into the life of
its Founder, the authenticity of its records, the completion
of its prophecies, the sublimity of its doctrines, the purity of
its precepts, and the arguments of its adversaries.

<head>Charles V.</head>

<p>
Emperor of Germany, king of Spain, and lord of the Netherlands,
born at Ghent, in the year 1500.
</p>

<p>
He is said to have fought sixty battles, in most of which
he was victorious, to have obtained six triumphs, conquered
four kingdoms, and to have added eight principalities to his
dominions&mdash;an almost unparalleled instance of worldly prosperity
and the greatness of human glory.
</p>

<p>
But all these fruits of his ambition, and all the honors
which attended him, could not yield true and solid satisfaction.
Reflecting on the evils and miseries which he had occasioned,
<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>
and convinced of the emptiness of earthly magnificence, he
became disgusted with the splendor that surrounded him,
and thought it his duty to withdraw from it, and spend the
rest of his days in religious retirement. Accordingly, he voluntarily
resigned all his dominions to his brother and son;
and, after taking an affectionate and last farewell of the
latter, and a numerous retinue of princes and nobility who
respectfully attended him, he repaired to his chosen retreat,
which was situated in Spain, in a vale of no great extent,
watered by a small brook, and surrounded with rising grounds
covered with lofty trees.
</p>

<p>
A deep sense of his frail condition and great imperfections
appears to have impressed his mind in this extraordinary
resolution, and through the remainder of his life. As soon
as he landed in Spain, he fell prostrate on the ground, and
considering himself now as dead to the world, he kissed the
earth, and said, <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of
mankind!</q>
</p>

<p>
In this humble retreat, he spent his time in religious
exercises and innocent employments, and buried here, in
solitude and silence, his grandeur and his ambition, together
with all those vast projects, which, for near half a century,
had alarmed and agitated Europe, and filled every kingdom
in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of
being subjected to his power. Far from taking any part in
the political transactions of the world, he restrained his curiosity
even from any inquiry concerning them, and seemed to
view the busy scene he had abandoned with an elevation
and indifference of mind which arose from his thorough experience
of its vanity, as well as from the pleasing reflection
of having disengaged himself from its cares and temptations.
</p>

<p>
Here he enjoyed more complete contentment than all his
grandeur had ever yielded him; as a full proof of which he
has left this short but comprehensive testimony:&mdash;<q>I have
tasted more satisfaction in my solitude, in one day, than in
all the triumphs of my former reign. The sincere study,
<pb n='407'/><anchor id='Pg407'/>
profession, and practice, of the Christian religion have in
them such joys and sweetness as are seldom found in courts
and grandeur.</q>

knowledge, wisdom, and benevolence, were very extraordinary.
Lord Bacon died in 1626.
</p>

<p>
That this illustrious character was deeply influenced by
a truly humble and religious spirit, is manifest from the
following prayer, which was found amongst his papers, in
his own hand-writing:&mdash;

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<q rend='pre'>Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; my
creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter! thou soundest and
searchest the depths and secrets of all hearts; thou acknowledgest
the upright; thou judgest the hypocrite; vanity
and crooked ways cannot be hid from thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Remember, O Lord, how thy servant has walked before
thee; remember what I have first sought, and what has been
principal in my intentions. I have loved thy assemblies; I
have mourned for the divisions of thy church; I have delighted
in the brightness of thy sanctuary; I have ever
prayed unto thee, that the vine which thy right hand hath
planted in this nation, might have the former and the latter
rain, and that it might stretch its branches to the seas and
to the floods. The state and bread of the poor and oppressed
have been precious in my eyes; I have hated all cruelty and
hardness of heart; I have, though a despised weed, endeavored
to procure the good of all men. If any have been
my enemies, I thought not of them, neither has the sun gone
down upon my displeasure; but I have been as a dove, free
from superfluity of maliciousness. Thy creatures have been
my books, but thy Scriptures much more so. I have sought
<pb n='408'/><anchor id='Pg408'/>
thee in the courts, the fields, and the gardens; but I have
found thee in thy temples.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Lord, my strength! I have, from my youth, met with
thee in all my ways; in thy fatherly compassions, in thy
merciful chastisements, and in thy most visible providences.
As thy favors have increased upon me, so have thy corrections;
as my worldly blessings were exalted, so secret darts
from thee have pierced me; and when I have ascended before
men, I have descended in humiliation before thee. And
now, when I have been thinking most of peace and honor,
thy hand is heavy upon me, and has humbled me according
to thy former loving-kindness, keeping me still in thy fatherly
school, not as a bastard, but as a child. Just are thy judgments
upon me for my sins, which are more in number than
the sands of the sea, but which have no proportion to thy
mercies. Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before
thee, that I am a debtor to thee for the gracious talent of
thy gifts and graces; which I have neither put into a napkin
nor placed, as I ought, with exchangers, where it might have
made best profit; but I have misspent it in things for which
I was least fit: so I may truly say, my soul hath been a
stranger in the course of my pilgrimage. Be merciful unto
me, O Lord, for my Savior's sake, and receive me into thy
bosom, or guide me into thy ways.</q>

<head>Matthew Hale.</head>

<p>
Lord chief justice of England, born in Gloucestershire,
in the year 1609, and, by the care of a wise and religious
father, had great attention paid to his education.
</p>

<p>
In his youth, he was fond of company, and fell into many
levities and extravagances. But this propensity and conduct
were corrected by a circumstance that made a considerable
impression on his mind during the rest of his life. Being
one day in company with other young men, one of the party,
through excess of wine, fell down, apparently dead, at their
feet. Young Hale was so affected on this occasion, that he
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>
immediately retired to another room, and, shutting the door,
fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly to God that his friend
might be restored to life, and that he himself might be pardoned
for having given countenance to so much excess. At
the same time, he made a solemn vow that he would never
again keep company in that manner, nor <q>drink a health</q>
while he lived. His friend recovered, and Hale religiously
observed his vow. After this event, there was an entire
change in his disposition; he forsook all dissipated company,
and was careful to divide his time between the duties of
religion and the studies of his profession.
</p>

<p>
He became remarkable for his solid and grave deportment,
his inflexible regard to justice, and a religious tenderness of
spirit, which appear to have accompanied him through life.
His retired meditations on religious subjects manifest a pious
and humble frame of mind, and a solemnity well adapted to
excite kindred emotions in the breast of the reader.
</p>

<p>
<q>True religion,</q> says he, <q>teaches the soul a high veneration
for Almighty God, a sincere and upright walking, as in
the presence of the invisible, all-seeing God. It makes a
man truly love, honor, and obey him, and therefore careful
to know what his will is. It renders the heart highly thankful
to him, as his Creator, Redeemer, and Benefactor. It
makes a man entirely depend on him, seek him for guidance,
direction, and protection, and submit to his will with patience
and resignation of soul. It gives the law, not only to his
words and actions, but to his very thoughts and purposes; so
that he dares not entertain any which are unbecoming the
presence of that God by whom all our thoughts are legible.
It crushes all pride and haughtiness, both in a man's heart and
carriage, and gives him an humble state of mind before God
and men. It regulates the passions, and brings them into
due moderation. It gives a man a right estimate of this
present world, and sets his heart and hopes above it; so that
he never loves it more than it deserves. It makes the wealth
and the glory of this world,&mdash;high places and great preferments,&mdash;of
but little consequence to him; so that he is
<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>
neither covetous, nor ambitious, nor over-solicitous, concerning
the advantages of them. It makes him value the
love of God and the peace of his own conscience above all
the wealth and honor in the world, and to be very diligent in
preserving them. He performs all his duties to God with
sincerity and humility; and, whilst he lives on earth, his
conversation, his hope, his treasures, are in heaven; and he
endeavors to walk suitably to such a hope.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They who truly fear God, have a secret guidance from a
higher wisdom than what is barely human, namely, the Spirit
of truth and goodness; which does really, though secretly,
prevent and direct them. Any man that sincerely and truly
fears Almighty God, and calls and relies upon him for his direction,
has it as really as a son has the counsel and direction
of his father; and though the voice be not audible, nor discernible
by sense, yet it is equally as real as if a man heard a
voice, saying, <q>This is the way; walk in it.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Though this secret direction of Almighty God is principally
seen in matters relating to the good of the soul, yet,
even in the concerns of this life, a good man fearing God,
and begging his direction, will very often, if not at all times,
find it. I can call my own experience to witness, that even
in the temporal affairs of my whole life, I have never been
disappointed of the best direction, when I have, in humility
and sincerity, implored it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The observance of the secret admonition of this Spirit
of God in the heart, is an effectual means to cleanse and
sanctify us; and the more it is attended to, the more it will
be conversant with our souls, for our instruction. In the
midst of difficulties, it will be our counsellor; in the midst
of temptations, it will be our strength, and grace sufficient
for us; in the midst of troubles, it will be our light and our
comforter.</q>
</p>

<p>
Chief Justice Hale died on the twenty-fifth of December,
1676.

<head>Princess Elizabeth.</head>

<p>
Princess of the Rhine, born in the year 1620. She was the
eldest daughter of Frederick V., elector palatine and king of
Bohemia, by Anne, daughter of James I., king of England.
This excellent princess possessed only a small territory;
but she governed it with great judgment and attention
to the happiness of her subjects. She made it a rule to
hear, one day in the week, all such causes as were brought
before her. On these occasions, her wisdom, justice, and
moderation, were very conspicuous. She frequently remitted
forfeitures, in cases where the parties were poor, or
in any respect worthy of favor. It was remarkable that she
often introduced religious considerations as motives to persuade
the contending parties to harmony and peace. She
was greatly beloved and respected by her subjects, and also
by many persons of learning and virtue not resident in her
dominions; for she patronized men of this character, whatever
might be their country or religious profession.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1677, the famous William Penn paid her a
visit, and was treated by her with great respect. The following
account of her is taken from his works:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<q rend='pre'>The meekness and humility of the princess appeared to
me extraordinary: she did not consider the quality, but the
merit, of the people she entertained. Did she hear of a
retired man, seeking after the knowledge of a better world,
she was sure to set him down in the catalogue of her charity,
if he wanted it. I have casually seen, I believe, fifty tokens
of her benevolence, sealed and directed to the several poor
subjects of her bounty, whose distance prevented them from
being personally known to her. Thus, though she kept no
sumptuous table in her own court, she spread the tables of
the poor in their solitary cells; breaking bread to virtuous
pilgrims, according to their wants and her ability.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She was abstemious in her living, and in apparel void of
all vain ornaments. I must needs say, that her mind had a
noble prospect: her eye was to a better and more lasting
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>
inheritance, than can be found below. This made her not
overrate the honors of her station, or the learning of the
schools, of which she was an excellent judge. Being once
at Hamburgh, a religious person, whom she went to see for
religion's sake, remarked to her, that <q>it was too great an
honor for him, that a visitant of her quality, who was allied
to so many great kings and princes of this world, should
come under his roof:</q> to whom she humbly replied, <q>If they
were religious, as well as great, it would be an honor indeed;
but if you knew what that greatness was, as well as I do, you
would value it less.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>After a religious meeting which we had in her chamber,
she was much affected, and said, <q>It is a hard thing to be
faithful to what one knows. O, the way is strait! I am
afraid I am not weighty enough in my spirit to walk in it.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She once withdrew, on purpose to give her servants, who
were religiously disposed, the liberty of discoursing with us
that they might the more freely put what questions of conscience
they desired to be satisfied in. Sometimes she suffered
both them and the poorest persons of her town to sit
by her in her own chamber, where we had two meetings. I
cannot forget her last words, when I took my leave of her:&mdash;<q>Let
me desire you to remember me, though I live at so
great a distance, and you should never see me more. I thank
you for this good time. Be assured that, though my condition
subjects me to divers temptations, yet my soul has strong
desires after the best things.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She lived till the age of sixty years, and then departed at
her house in Herwerden, in the year 1680, as much lamented
as she had been beloved by her people. To her real worth I
do, with a religious gratitude, dedicate this memorial.</q>

<head>Robert Boyle.</head>

<p>
An eminent philosopher, and a truly good man, was the son
of Richard, earl of Cork, and was born at Lismore, in
Ireland, in the year 1627. At Eton School, where he was
<pb n='413'/><anchor id='Pg413'/>
educated, he soon discovered a force of understanding which
promised great things, and a disposition to improve it to the
utmost. During his education, and before he was ten years
old, he was much afflicted with an ague, which considerably
depressed his spirits; and, to divert his attention, he was
persuaded to read Amadis de Gaul, and other romantic books.
But this kind of reading, he says in his memoirs, produced
such restlessness in him, that he was obliged to apply himself
to mathematical studies, in order to fix and settle the volatility
of his fancy. He died in the sixty-fifth year of his age.
</p>

<p>
He was a man of great learning, and his stock of knowledge
was immense. The celebrated Dr. Boerhaave has passed
the following eulogium upon him:&mdash;<q>Boyle was the ornament
of his age and country. Which of his writings shall I commend?
All of them. To him we owe the secrets of fire, air,
water, animals, vegetables, fossils; so that from his works may
be deduced the whole system of natural knowledge.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was treated with particular kindness and respect by
Charles II., as well as by the two great ministers Southampton
and Clarendon. By the latter he was solicited
to enter into orders; for his distinguished learning and
unblemished reputation induced Lord Clarendon to think
that so very respectable a personage would do great honor to
the clergy. Boyle considered the proposal with due attention.
He reflected that, in his present situation of life,
whatever he wrote with respect to religion, would have
greater weight, as coming from a layman; for he well knew
that the irreligious fortified themselves against all that the
clergy could offer, by supposing and saying that it was their
trade, and that they were paid for it. He considered, likewise,
that, in point of fortune and character, he needed no
accessions; and, indeed, his desire for these was always very
limited. But Bishop Burnet, to whom Boyle had communicated
memorandums concerning his life, tells us that what
had the greatest weight in determining his judgment, was,
<q>the not feeling within himself any motion or tendency of
mind which he could safely esteem a call from the Holy
<pb n='414'/><anchor id='Pg414'/>
Spirit, and so not venturing to take holy orders, lest he
should be found to have lied unto it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Bishop Burnet, who was Boyle's particular friend, and who,
during an acquaintance of twenty-nine years, had spent many
happy hours in conversation with him, gives a full account of
his genuine piety and virtue, and of his zeal for the Christian
religion. <q>This zeal,</q> he says, <q>was unmixed with narrow
notions, or a bigoted heat in favor of a particular sect; it
was that spirit which is the ornament of a true Christian.</q>
Burnet mentions, as a proof of this, his noble foundation for
lectures in defence of the gospel, against infidels of all sorts;
the effects of which have been very conspicuous, in the many
volumes of excellent discourses, which have been published
in consequence of that laudable and pious design.
</p>

<p>
The great object of his philosophical pursuits was to promote
the cause of religion, and to discountenance atheism
and infidelity. His intimate friend Bishop Burnet makes
the following observations on this point:&mdash;<q>It appeared to
those who conversed with him on his inquiries into nature,
that his main design (on which as he had his own eye constantly
fixed, so he took care to put others often in mind of
it) was to raise in himself and others more exalted sentiments
of the greatness and glory, the wisdom and goodness, of God.
This design was so deeply impressed on his mind, that he
concludes the article of his will, which relates to the Royal
Society, in these words:&mdash;<q>I wish them a happy success in
their attempts to discover the true nature of the works of
God; and I pray that they, and all searchers into physical
truths, may cordially refer their attainments to the glory of
the great Author of nature, and to the comfort of mankind.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, the same person speaks of him thus&mdash;<q>He
had the most profound veneration for the great God
of heaven and earth that I ever observed in any man. The
very name of God was never mentioned by him without a
pause and observable stop in his discourse.</q> So brightly
did the example of this great and good man shine, through
his whole course, that Bishop Burnet, on reviewing it, in a
<pb n='415'/><anchor id='Pg415'/>
moment of pious exultation thus expressed himself:&mdash;<q>I
might challenge the whole tribe of libertines to come and
view the usefulness, as well as the excellence, of the Christian
religion, in a life that was entirely dedicated to it.</q>

<head>John Locke.</head>

<p>
A very celebrated philosopher, and one of the greatest men
that England ever produced, born in the year 1632. He
was well educated; and, applying himself with vigor to his
studies, his mind became enlarged, and stored with much
useful knowledge. He went abroad as secretary to the English
ambassador at several of the German courts, and afterwards
had the offer of being made envoy at the court of the
emperor, or of any other that he chose; but he declined the
proposal, on account of the infirm state of his health. He
was a commissioner of trade and plantations, in which station
he very honorably distinguished himself. Notwithstanding
his public employments, he found leisure to write much for
the benefit of mankind. His <q>Essay on Human Understanding,</q>
his <q>Discourses on Government,</q> and his <q>Letters on
Toleration,</q> are justly held in the highest esteem.
</p>

<p>
This enlightened man and profound reasoner was most
firmly attached to the Christian religion. His zeal to promote
it appeared, first, in his middle age, by publishing a
discourse to demonstrate the reasonableness of believing Jesus
to be the promised Messiah; and, afterwards, in the latter
part of his life, by a Commentary on several of the Epistles
of the apostle Paul. The sacred Scriptures are every where
mentioned by him with the greatest reverence; and he exhorts
Christians <q>to betake themselves in earnest to the study of
the way to salvation, in those holy writings, wherein God has
revealed it from heaven, and proposed it to the world; seeking
our religion where we are sure it is in truth to be found,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a letter written the year before his death, to one who
asked this question, <q>What is the shortest and surest way
<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>
for a young man to attain the true knowledge of the Christian
religion?</q> he says, <q>Let him study the holy Scriptures,
especially the New Testament: therein are contained the
words of eternal life. It has God for its author; salvation
for its end; and truth, without any mixture of error, for its
matter.</q> This advice was conformable to his own practice.
<q>For fourteen or fifteen years, he applied himself in an
especial manner to the study of the Scriptures, and employed
the last years of his life hardly in any thing else. He
was never weary of admiring the great views of that sacred
book, and the just relation of all its parts: he every day made
discoveries in it that gave him fresh cause of admiration.</q>
</p>

<p>
The consolation which he derived from divine revelation
is forcibly expressed in these words:&mdash;<q>I gratefully receive
and rejoice in the light of revelation, which has set me at
rest in many things, the manner whereof my poor reason can
by no means make out to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
After he had diligently employed a great part of his life in
a variety of occupations, he chose a pleasing retirement for
the remainder of his days. This leisure appears to have been
productive of solid improvement, by enabling him to look
calmly over the scenes of past life; to form a proper estimate
of its enjoyments, and to dedicate himself more fully to the
cause of piety and virtue.
</p>

<p>
About two months before his death, in 1704, he wrote a
letter to his friend Anthony Collins, and left this direction
upon it:&mdash;<q>To be delivered to him after my decease.</q> It
concludes with the following remarkable words:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<q>May you live long and happy, in the enjoyment of health,
freedom, content, and all those blessings which Providence
has bestowed on you, and to which your virtue entitles you.
You loved me living, and will preserve my memory when I
am dead. All the use to be made of it is, that this life is a
scene of vanity, which soon passes away, and affords no solid
satisfaction, but in the consciousness of doing well, and in
the hopes of another life. This is what I can say upon
experience; and what you will find to be true, when you
come to make up the account. Adieu!</q>

<head>Joseph Addison.</head>

<p>
A celebrated English writer, born at Milston, in Wiltshire,
in the year 1672. About the age of fifteen, he was
entered at Queen's College, Oxford, where, by his fine parts
and great application, he made a surprising proficiency in
classical learning. Before he left the university, he was
warmly solicited to enter into orders; and he once resolved
to do so; but his great modesty, and an uncommonly delicate
sense of the importance of the sacred function, made him
afterwards alter his resolution. He was highly respected by
many of the greatest and the most learned of his contemporaries.
He travelled into Italy, where he made many useful
observations, and prepared materials for some of his literary
works. On his return to England, he was chosen one of the
lords commissioners for trade. In 1709, he was appointed
secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and, in 1717, was
advanced to the high office of secretary of state. He died
in 1729.
</p>

<p>
His writings have been of great use to the world, and his
<q>Evidences of the Christian Religion</q> not the least so. Dr.
Johnson, in delineating his character as a writer, gives the
following amiable picture of him:&mdash;<q>He employed wit on
the side of virtue and religion. He not only made the proper
use of wit himself, but taught it to others; and, from his
time, it has been generally subservient to the cause of reason
and truth. He has dissipated the prejudice that had long
connected cheerfulness with vice, and easiness of manners
with laxity of principles. He has restored virtue to its dignity,
and taught innocence not to be ashamed. This is an
elevation of literary character above all Greek, above all
Roman fame. As a teacher of wisdom, he may be confidently
followed. His religion has nothing in it enthusiastic
or superstitious; he appears neither weakly credulous nor
wantonly skeptical; his morality is neither dangerously lax
nor impracticably rigid. All the enchantment of fancy, and
all the cogency of argument, are employed to recommend to
the reader his real interest&mdash;the care of pleasing the Author
of his being.</q>
</p>

<pb n='418'/><anchor id='Pg418'/>

<p>
Of his integrity in discharging the duties of his office,
there is a striking proof recorded. When he was secretary
in Ireland, he had materially promoted the interest of an individual,
who offered him, in return, a bank note of three
hundred pounds, and a diamond ring of the same value.
These he strenuously refused to accept, and wrote to the
person as follows:&mdash;<q>And now, sir, believe me, when I assure
you I never did, nor ever will, on any pretence whatsoever,
take more than the stated and customary fees of my
office. I might keep the contrary practice concealed from
the world, were I capable of it, but I could not from myself;
and I hope I shall always fear the reproaches of my own
heart more than those of all mankind.</q>
</p>

<p>
A mind conscious of its own uprightness, and humbly
trusting in the goodness of God, has the best ground to look
forward with complacency towards another life. The following
lines of Addison are sweetly expressive of the peace and
pleasure which he enjoyed in contemplating his future existence:&mdash;<q>The
prospect of a future state is the secret comfort
and refreshment of my soul. It is that which makes
nature look cheerful about me; it doubles all my pleasures,
and supports me under all my afflictions. I can look at disappointments
and misfortunes, pain and sickness, death itself,
with indifference, so long as I keep in view the pleasures of
eternity, and the state of being in which there will be no
fears nor apprehensions, pains nor sorrows.</q>

<head>Isaac Watts.</head>

<p>
A learned and eminent dissenting minister, born at Southampton,
in the year 1674, of parents who were distinguished
by their piety and virtue. He died in 1748. He possessed
an uncommon genius, of which he gave early proofs. He
received a very liberal education, which was rendered highly
beneficial to him by his own unwearied efforts to improve
himself. After the most serious deliberation, he determined
to devote his life to the ministry, of the importance of which
<pb n='419'/><anchor id='Pg419'/>
office he had a deep and awful sense. He labored very diligently
to promote the instruction and happiness of the people
under his care, to whom, by his Christian conduct and amiable
disposition, he greatly endeared himself.
</p>

<p>
Soon after he had undertaken the pastoral office, his health
sustained a severe shock by a painful and dangerous illness,
from which he recovered very slowly. But, in the year 1712,
he was afflicted with a violent fever, that entirely broke his
constitution, and left such weakness upon his nerves, as continued
with him, in some measure, to his dying day. For
four years he was wholly prevented from discharging the public
offices of his station. Though this long interval of sickness
was, no doubt, very trying to his active mind, yet it
proved ultimately a blessing to him; for it drew upon him
the particular notice of Sir Thomas Abney, a very pious and
worthy man, who, from motives of friendship, invited him into
his family, in which he continued to the end of his life, and,
for the long space of thirty-six years, was treated with uniform
kindness, attention, and respect.
</p>

<p>
This excellent man was, by his natural temper, quick of
resentment; but, by his established and habitual practice, he
was gentle, modest, and inoffensive. His tenderness appeared
in his attention to children and to the poor. To the poor,
while he lived in the family of his friend, he allowed the
third part of his annual revenue; and for children, he condescended
to lay aside the scholar, the philosopher, and the
wit, to write little poems of devotion, and systems of instruction,
adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn of
reason, through its gradations of advance in the morning of
life. Few men have left behind them such purity of character,
or such monuments of laborious piety. He has provided
instruction for all ages, from those who are lisping their
first lessons, to the enlightened readers of Malebranche and
Locke. His <q>Improvement of the Mind</q> is a work in
the highest degree useful and pleasing. Whatever he took in
hand was, by his incessant solicitude for souls, converted to
theology. As piety predominated in his mind, it is diffused
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
over his works. Under his direction, it may be truly said
that philosophy is subservient to evangelical instruction: it is
difficult to read a page without learning, or at least wishing
to be better.
</p>

<p>
The virtue of this good man eminently appeared in the
happy state of his mind under great pains and weakness of
body, and in the improvement which he derived from them.
Of those seasons of affliction, he says, with a truly elevated
mind and thankful heart, <q>I am not afraid to let the world
know that, amidst the sinkings of life and nature, Christianity
and the gospel were my support. Amidst all the violence of
my distemper, and the tiresome months of it, I thank God I
never lost sight of reason or religion, though sometimes I had
much difficulty to preserve the machine of animal nature in
such order as regularly to exercise either the man or the
Christian.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sweet peace of conscience he enjoyed under these
trying circumstances, and the rational and Christian foundation
of his hope and trust in the divine goodness, are beautifully
and justly expressed by him, in the following lines:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Yet, gracious God, amid these storms of nature,</q></l>
<l>Thine eyes behold a sweet and sacred calm</l>
<l>Reign through the realms of conscience; all within</l>
<l>Lies peaceful, all composed. 'Tis wondrous grace</l>
<l>Keeps off thy terrors from this humble bosom;</l>
<l>Though stained with sins and follies, yet serene</l>
<l>In penitential peace and cheerful hope,</l>
<l>Sprinkled and guarded with atoning blood,</l>
<l>Thy vital smiles, amidst this desolation,</l>
<l>Like heavenly sunbeams hid behind the clouds,</l>
<l>Break out in happy moments, with bright radiance</l>
<l>Cleaving the gloom; the fair, celestial light,</l>
<l>Softens and gilds the horrors of the storm,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>And richest cordials to the heart conveys.</q></l>

<head>Philip Doddridge.</head>

<p>
Born in London, in the year 1702. His parents, who
were persons of great worth, brought him up in an early
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>
knowledge of religion; but he had the misfortune to lose
them before he was fourteen years old. This circumstance
excited in his mind very serious reflections, which, however,
were not wholly of a gloomy nature; for he expressed a devout,
and even a cheerful trust in the protection of the God
of mercies, the universal Parent of mankind.
</p>

<p>
He diligently improved his time, and was anxious to be
daily advancing in knowledge, piety, virtue, and usefulness.
He possessed strong powers of mind, and, by unwearied application,
acquired a large fund of sound and elegant learning.
His publications, which are chiefly on religious subjects,
have been eminently useful to the world. By his
literary acquisitions, his amiable disposition, and his desire
to imbue the young mind with knowledge and virtue, he was
qualified, in a peculiar manner, to become the instructor of
youth; and for many years he superintended a very respectable
academy. As the pastor of a congregation, he manifested
a sincere and zealous regard for the happiness of the
people under his care, by whom he was greatly honored and
beloved.
</p>

<p>
He possessed many virtues; but the prime and leading
feature of his soul was devotion. He was very solicitous to
preserve and cultivate an habitual sense of the Supreme
Being, to maintain and increase the ardor of religion in his
heart, and to prepare himself, by devout exercises, for the important
labors of his station. Nor was it to his secret retirements
that his piety was limited; it was manifested in every
part of the day, and appeared in his usual intercourse with
men. In the little vacancies of time which occur to the
busiest of mankind, he was frequently lifting up his soul to
God. When he lectured on philosophy, history, anatomy, or
other subjects not immediately theological, he would endeavor
to graft some religious instructions upon them, that he might
raise the minds of his pupils to devotion, as well as to knowledge;
and, in his visits to his people, the Christian friend
and minister were united.
</p>

<p>
The piety of Dr. Doddridge was accompanied with the
<pb n='422'/><anchor id='Pg422'/>
warmest benevolence to his fellow-creatures. No one could
more strongly feel that the love of God was to be united with
love to man. Nor was this a principle that rested in kind
wishes and pathetic feelings for the happiness of others,
but it was manifested in the most active exertions for their
welfare. No scheme of doing good was ever suggested to
him into which he did not enter with ardor. But the generosity
of his mind was most displayed when any plans of
propagating religion, and of spreading the gospel among
those who were strangers to it, were proposed. In every
thing of this kind he was always ready to take the lead, and
was ardent in endeavoring to inspire his friends with the same
spirit.
</p>

<p>
He was of a weak and delicate bodily constitution; and a
severe cold which he caught about the forty-eighth year of
his age, brought on a consumption of the lungs. The nearer
he approached to his dissolution, the more plainly was observed
his continual improvement in a spiritual and heavenly
temper. Indeed, he seemed to have risen above the world,
and to be daily breathing after immortality. This disposition
of his mind was ardently expressed in several of his letters,
and is manifest from his will, which was made at this time,
and is prefaced in the following language:&mdash;<q>Whereas it is
customary, on these occasions, to begin with commending the
soul into the hands of God, through Christ, I do it; not in
mere form, but with sincerity and joy; esteeming it my greatest
happiness, that I am taught and encouraged to do it, by that
glorious gospel, which, having most assuredly believed, I
have spent my life in preaching to others; and which I esteem
an infinitely greater treasure than all my little worldly store,
or possessions ten thousand times greater than mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
A short time before his death, he had been induced to try
the mild air of the south; but change of climate did not
produce the desired effect, and Dr. Doddridge continued
gradually to weaken, till death put a period to his afflictions.
In his last hours, he preserved the same calmness, vigor, and
joy of mind, which he had felt and expressed through the
<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>
whole of his illness. The only pain he had in the thought
of dying, was the fear of that grief and distress which his
wife would suffer from his removal. To his children, his
congregation, and his friends in general, he desired to be remembered
in the most affectionate manner; nor did he, in
the effusions of his pious benevolence, forget the family where
he lodged, or his own servant. Many devout sentiments and
aspirations were uttered by him; but the heart of his wife
was too much affected with his approaching change to be able
to recollect them distinctly. Though he died in a foreign
land, and, in a certain sense, among strangers, his decease
was embalmed with many tears. His age was 49 years.

<head>John Murray.</head>

<p>
A distinguished preacher of Universalism in the United
States, born in Alton, county of Hampshire, England,
on the 10th of December, 1741.
</p>

<p>
When he had attained his eleventh year, the family removed
to Ireland, in the vicinity of Cork. While here, he
was converted to Methodism, and gained the attention of
John Wesley, by whom he was appointed a class-leader. He
was very earnest and devout in his religious exercises, and
was regarded by his brethren as a valuable accession to their
church. About this time his father died, and he shortly after
left Ireland for England. He took up his residence in London,
and was gradually led into gay society. The secret
monitor, however, frequently reproached him, and finally
brought him back again to the services of the sanctuary, and
quickened the flame of religious devotion. At this time his
prejudices against Universalism were very strong; his soul
<q>kindled with indignation</q> against them. But, shortly after
his marriage to a very amiable young lady of London, he was
induced to visit Mr. Relly's chapel, the preacher of universal
salvation; and, notwithstanding he had been so filled with
wrath against Mr. Relly, that, as he subsequently said, he
thought it would have been doing both God and man service
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>
to kill him, yet he was moved to tenderness by his preaching
and subsequently became an attendant on his ministry.
Rich were the consolations enjoyed by him and his amiable
wife in their new faith. But great sorrows awaited him;
she sickened and died; and the death-scene is described by
himself, in his autobiography, with thrilling effect. He
would gladly have accompanied her to the spirit-world. He
was now alone; he felt himself a solitary being; he had no
taste for the joys of life; his mind dwelt only on death and
eternity; he was unfitted for society; and in this state of
mind, Providence seems to have directed his thoughts to
America. He resolved to embark; and, in the month of
September, 1770, he landed upon the shores of New Jersey.
Here he became at once acquainted with a philanthropic
landholder, by the name of Thomas Potter, who, in the belief
that God would send him a preacher, had erected a
meeting-house, and who insisted that Murray was the man
whom God had sent. In this house Murray commenced his
labors as a preacher; and from this time, he is to be contemplated
as the public advocate of Universalism, on the system
of Relly. He soon visited the city of New York, and various
other cities and towns in the Middle States, preaching
the gospel whithersoever he went. His first visit to Boston
was made in October, 1773, and his second in September,
1774. It was during this second visit that he was stoned in the
pulpit of Rev. Mr. Croswell, in School Street. About this time
he visited Gloucester, Massachusetts, which was afterwards
his residence for many years. In 1775, he was appointed by
General Washington chaplain to the Rhode Island troops, in
the army then lying around Boston. He soon, however, returned
to his charge in Gloucester, where he remained, making
frequent visits to different parts of the United States,
until October, 1793, when he was ordained pastor of the First
Universalist Society in Boston, which had purchased the
house of worship formerly occupied by the society of Dr.
Samuel Mather. His labors were not confined to this society,
however; in one respect he was a minister at large;
<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>
he continued his itinerant habits, more or less, until October,
1809, when he was stricken with the palsy. He lived nearly
six years after this affliction, and expired on the third day of
September, 1815. He was buried in the Granary burying-ground,
where his remains were suffered to lie unhonored
until 1837, when they were removed to Mount Auburn, and
a monument was erected to his memory. The monument is
a beautiful fluted column, surmounted by an urn. It is encircled
by a belt, or tablet, on which two inscriptions are
placed; on one side&mdash;

<head>Elhanan Winchester.</head>

<p>
A distinguished advocate of Universalism, born in Brookline,
Massachusetts, September 30, 1751. In his nineteenth
year, he was converted, under the preaching of the Baptists;
and it was by his labors that the present Baptist society in
Newton was originally gathered. In the autumn of 1774, he
made a journey to the Southern States. Early in 1778, he
first saw Siegvolk's <q>Everlasting Gospel,</q> a work which
originally appeared in Holland, but which had been translated
and published by the Mennonites of Pennsylvania. It
made a very deep impression upon his mind. In 1779, he
came back to New England, his convictions of the truth of
Universalism increasing upon him daily. He set out on his
return to South Carolina in the autumn of 1780, and arrived
at Philadelphia on the 7th of October. Here he intended to
remain but a few days; but God evidently had a great work
for him to do in this place. Even his enemies acknowledged
<pb n='426'/><anchor id='Pg426'/>
that his <q>manner of preaching was popular, his
address very fascinating, and his appearance dignified and
commanding.</q> The Baptist church in that city invited him
to tarry and preach to them, and he at length consented.
About this time he read <q>Stonehouse on Universal Restitution,</q>
which served to confirm him greatly in his belief of
that doctrine. Notwithstanding his great popularity, a
discontent began to show itself in certain members of the
church. He foresaw that a storm was rising, and he determined
to prepare for it; not (to use his words) <q>by denying
what I had said, but by more fully examining, and determining
for myself, whether the sentiment was according to
Scripture, or not. If I found it was not, I was determined
to retract; but if it was, to hold it fast, let the consequences
be what they might.</q> Such was his truly Christian resolution.
He avowed his belief in the final happiness of all men.
</p>

<p>
A majority of the church were in his favor; but, being a
man of remarkably peaceful disposition, he did not urge them
to press their claims to the meeting-house; but they retired
to the hall of the university, where they held their meetings
for about four years, until they purchased a place for themselves.
During the rest of his life, he is to be viewed as
the public advocate of universal restitution. There were
several eminent men who adhered to him, and among others,
Dr. Redman, and the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush, who
remained his correspondent when he was in Europe. Added
to all his other troubles, his domestic afflictions were very
great. At the age of thirty-two, he had buried four wives.
The fifth was a desperate fury, who gave him great trouble
as long as he lived. After preaching about six years in
Philadelphia, he was seized with an irresistible impulse to
visit England. No persuasions could divert him from the
purpose; and in September, 1787, he arrived, almost penniless,
and a total stranger, in the great metropolis of the British
empire. He preached in different parts of London, and,
by his fervid eloquence and earnest defence of the restoration,
he soon gathered a congregation, who took for him the
<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>
chapel in Parliament Court, in which he held his meetings
until his departure for America. He spent six years and a
half in this country, laboring assiduously to bring men to the
knowledge of the truth; and a deep and wide impression
was made by his labors. In consequence of the ill treatment
he experienced from his wife, he was obliged to leave her;
and he quitted England privately, and came home, filling the
friends whom he had left behind with amazement, being
ignorant at first what had befallen him. He arrived in Boston
in July, 1794. Various were the speculations in this country
in regard to his return. But he commenced at once his
labors as a preacher, travelling in several of the states,&mdash;visited
his former friends in Philadelphia, where he was
joined by his wife, who had come home to America, and
whom he freely forgave. It became evident, about this
time, that his health was greatly impaired; and an increasing
asthma foretold a fatal termination. He came to Hartford,
Connecticut, in October, 1796, and raised a congregation, to
which he preached until he could preach no more. In April,
1797, he delivered a sermon, under a strong presentiment
that it was his last, from St. Paul's farewell address to the
elders of the Ephesian church. He never entered the desk
again. He contemplated his death with serenity and joy.
On the morning of his decease, he commenced singing the
hymn with several of his friends,&mdash;<q>Farewell, my friends
in Christ below,</q> but his voice soon faltered, and the torpor
of death fell on him. His friends became disconcerted, and
ceased to sing; but he revived a little, and encouraged them
to go on, joining in the first line of each verse, until his voice
was actually <q>lost in death.</q> This was on the 18th of April,
1797, in the 47th year of his age. His funeral sermon was
preached by Rev. Dr. Strong, of Hartford, who bore a frank
testimony to Mr. Winchester's excellent character, and his
final constancy in the doctrine he had preached.

<head>Saint Genevieve.</head>

<p>
Born at Nanterre, about five miles from Paris, in the year
423, about the time of Pharamond, the first king of France.
St. Germain, bishop of Auxerre, observing in her, when yet
very young, a particular disposition to sanctity, advised her
to take a vow of perpetual virginity, which she accordingly
did in the presence of the bishop of Paris. After the death
of her parents, she went to Paris. The city was about to be
deserted, when Attila, with his Huns, broke into France;
but Genevieve assured the inhabitants of complete security,
if they would seek it by fervent prayers. Attila took his
course from Champaigne to Orleans, returned thence into
Champaigne, without touching Paris, and was defeated in
451. By this event, Genevieve's reputation was established.
In a time of famine, she went along the River Seine, from
city to city, and soon returned with twelve large vessels
loaded with grain, which she distributed gratuitously among
the sufferers. This increased her authority, and she was
highly honored by Merovæus and Chilperic. Nothing,
however, contributed more to her reputation for sanctity, than
the circumstance, that, from her fifteenth to her fiftieth year,
she ate nothing but barley-bread, except that she took some
beans every two or three weeks, and, after her fiftieth year,
some fish and milk. In 460, she built a church over the
graves of St. Dionysius Rusticus and Eleutherius, near the
village of Chasteville, where Dagobert afterwards founded
the abbey of St. Denys. She died in 499 or 501, and her
<pb n='429'/><anchor id='Pg429'/>
body was placed in the subterraneous chapel which St. Denys
had consecrated to the apostles Paul and Peter. Clovis, by
her request, built a church over it, which was afterwards
called by her name, as was also the abbey that was founded
there. Another church, consecrated to this saint, was built
adjoining to the church of Notre Dame. Her relics are
preserved in the former. The church celebrates the third
of January, the day on which she died, in honor of her.

<head>Gilbert Burnet.</head>

<p>
Bishop of Salisbury, was born at Edinburgh, in the year
1643. He was carefully educated by his father; and, having
a strong constitution and a prodigious memory, he applied
himself closely to study, and acquired a great portion of
learning and knowledge, which he seemed to have ready for
all occasions. He travelled through France, Italy, and Holland,
where he formed connections with many of the greatest
persons of his time, by whom he was much respected for his
talents and virtues. At Amsterdam, he became acquainted
with the leading men of the different persuasions tolerated
in the United Provinces&mdash;Calvinists, Arminians, Lutherans,
Anabaptists, Brownists, Roman Catholics, and Unitarians;
amongst each of which, he used frequently to declare, he
met with men of such unfeigned piety and virtue, that he
became strongly fixed in a principle of universal charity, and
an invincible abhorrence of all severities on account of religious
opinions.
</p>

<p>
The following sentiments, which he solemnly uttered towards
the conclusion of his days, are very expressive of the
nature and power of true religion, and of its influence upon
his own mind:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>I recommend,</q> he observes, <q rend='pre'>to all sorts of men, in the
most serious manner, the study and practice of religion, as
that which is the most important of all things, and which is
both the light of the world, and the salt of the earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Nothing so opens our faculties, and composes and directs
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>
the whole man, as an inward sense of God; of his authority
over us; of the laws he has set us; of his eye ever upon us;
of his hearing our prayers, assisting our endeavors, watching
over our concerns; of his being to judge, and reward or
punish, us in another state, according to what we have done
in this. Nothing will give us such a detestation of sin, and
such a sense of the goodness of God, and of our obligations
to holiness, as a right understanding and firm belief of the
Christian religion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By living according to the rules of religion, a man becomes
the wisest, the best, and the happiest creature that
he is capable of being. Honest industry, the employing
of time well, a constant sobriety, an undefiled purity and
chastity, with continued serenity, are the best preservatives,
too, of life and health; so that, take a man as an individual,
religion is his guard, his perfection, his beauty, and his glory.
This will make him a light in the world, shining brightly,
and enlightening many round about him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Thus religion, if truly received and sincerely adhered to,
would prove the greatest of all blessings to a nation. But by
religion I understand something more than receiving particular
doctrines, though ever so true, or professing them, and
engaging to support them, even with zeal and eagerness.
What signify the best doctrines, if men do not live suitably
to them; if they have not a due influence upon their thoughts
and their lives? Men of bad lives, with sound opinions, are
self-condemned, and lie under a highly-aggravated guilt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By religion I do not mean an outward compliance with
forms and customs, in going to church, to prayers, to sermons,
and to sacraments, with an external show of devotion;
or, which is more, with some inward forced good thoughts,
in which many satisfy themselves, while these have no visible
effect on their lives, nor any inward force to control and
rectify their appetites, passions, and secret designs. These
customary performances, how good and useful soever when
understood and rightly directed, are of little value when men
rest on them, and think, because they do them, they have
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>
acquitted themselves of their duty, though they still continue
proud, covetous, full of deceit, envy, and malice. Even secret
prayers, the most effectual means, are designed for a higher
end; which is, to possess our minds with such a constant
and present sense of divine truths, as may make these live
in us, and govern us, and draw down such assistance, as to
exalt and sanctify our natures.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>So that, by religion, I mean such a sense of divine truth
as enters into a man, and becomes the spring of a new nature
within him; reforming his thoughts and designs; purifying
his heart; sanctifying and governing his whole deportment,
his words as well as his actions; convincing him that it is
not enough not to be scandalously vicious, or to be innocent
in his conversation, but that he must be entirely, uniformly,
and constantly, pure and virtuous, animated with zeal to be
still better and better, more eminently good and exemplary.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is true religion, which is the perfection of human
nature, and the joy and delight of every one that feels it
active and strong within him. It is true, this is not arrived
at all at once, and it will have an unhappy alloy, hanging
long even about a good man; but, as those ill mixtures are
the perpetual grief of his soul, so that it is his chief care to
watch over and to mortify them, he will be in a continual
progress, still gaining ground upon himself; and as he attains
to a degree of purity, he will find a noble flame of life and
joy growing up in him. Of this I write with a greater concern
and emotion, because I have felt it to be the true, and,
indeed, the only joy which runs through a man's heart and
life. It is this which has been, for many years, my greatest
support. I rejoice daily in it. I feel from it the earnest of
that supreme joy which I want and long for; and I am sure
there is nothing else which can afford any true and complete
happiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
This eminent scholar, Christian, and divine, departed this
life on the seventeenth of March, 1714.
